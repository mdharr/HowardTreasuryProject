Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand . . . to tread\nthe jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.”\n\nIn a meteoric career that spanned a mere twelve years before his tragic suicide, Robert E. Howard single-handedly invented the genre that came to be called sword and sorcery. Collected in this volume, profusely illustrated by artist Mark Schultz, are Howard’s first thirteen Conan stories, appearing in their original versions–in some cases for the first time in more than seventy years–and in the order Howard wrote them. Along with classics of dark fantasy like “The Tower of the Elephant” and swashbuckling adventure like “Queen of the Black Coast,” The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian contains a wealth of material never before published in the United States, including the first submitted draft of Conan’s debut, “Phoenix on the Sword,” Howard’s synopses for “The Scarlet Citadel” and “Black Colossus,” and a map of Conan’s world drawn by the author himself.\n\nHere are timeless tales featuring Conan the raw and dangerous youth, Conan the daring thief, Conan the swashbuckling pirate, and Conan the commander of armies.

His careless attitude was not genuine; his eyes and ears were keenly alert, especially his ears, for no gaze could penetrate the leafy tangle for more than a few feet in either direction.\n\nBut it was instinct more than any warning by the external senses which brought him up suddenly, his hand on his hilt. He stood stock-still in the middle of the trail, unconsciously holding his breath, wondering what he had heard, and wondering if indeed he had heard anything. The silence seemed absolute. Not a squirrel chattered or bird chirped. Then his gaze fixed itself on a mass of bushes beside the trail a few yards ahead of him. There was no breeze, yet he had seen a branch quiver. The short hairs on his scalp prickled, and he stood for an instant undecided, certain that a move in either direction would bring death streaking at him from the bushes.\n\nA heavy chopping crunch sounded behind the leaves. The bushes were shaken violently, and simultaneously with the sound, an arrow arched erratically from among them and vanished among the trees along the trail. The wayfarer glimpsed its flight as he sprang frantically to cover.\n\nCrouching behind a thick stem, his sword quivering in his fingers, he saw the bushes part, and a tall figure stepped leisurely into the trail. The traveller stared in surprise. The stranger was clad like himself in regard to boots and breeks, though the latter were of silk instead of leather. But he wore a sleeveless hauberk of dark mesh-mail in place of a tunic, and a helmet perched on his black mane. That helmet held the other\'s gaze; it was without a crest, but adorned by short bull\'s horns. No civilized hand ever forged that head-piece. Nor was the face below it that of a civilized man: dark, scarred, with smoldering blue eyes, it was a face as untamed as the primordial forest which formed its background. The man held a broad-sword in his right hand, and the edge was smeared with crimson.', 'A thrilling novelette of the Picts and the wizard Zogar Sag — a startling weird saga of terrific adventures and dark magic.');

The man scowled and glanced quickly back the way he had come, as if fearing their flight had betrayed his position to some one unseen. Then he stalked across the glade, placing his feet with care. For all his massive, muscular build he moved with the supple certitude of a panther.\n\nHe was naked except for a rag twisted about his loins, and his limbs were criss-crossed with scratches from briars, and caked with dried mud. A brown- crusted bandage was knotted about his thickly-muscled left arm. Under his matted black mane his face was drawn and gaunt, and his eyes burned like the eyes of a wounded panther. He limped slightly as he followed the dim path that led across the open space.\n\nHalfway across the glade he stopped short and whirled, catlike, facing back the way he had come, as a long-drawn call quavered out across the forest. To another man it would have seemed merely the howl of a wolf. But this man knew it was no wolf. He was a Cimmerian and understood the voices of the wilderness as a city-bred man understands the voices of his friends.\n\nRage burned redly in his bloodshot eyes as he turned once more and hurried along the path, which, as it left the glade, ran along the edge of a dense thicket that rose in a solid clump of greenery among the trees and bushes. A massive log, deeply embedded in the grassy earth, paralleled the fringe of the thicket, lying between it and the path. When the Cimmerian saw this log he halted and looked back across the glade. To the average eye there were no signs to show that he had passed; but there was evidence visible to his wilderness-sharpened eyes, and therefore to the equally keen eyes of those who pursued him. He snarled silently, the red rage growing in his eyes—the berserk fury of a hunted beast which is ready to turn at bay.\n\nHe walked down the trail with comparative carelessness, here and there crushing a grass-blade beneath his foot. Then, when he had reached the further end of the great log, he sprang upon it, turned and ran lightly back along it. The bark had long been worn away by the elements. He left no sign to show the keenest forest- eyes that he had doubled on his trail.

To every man born in Canaan, there is always an invisible tie that draws him back whenever his homeland is imperiled by the murky shadow that has lurked in its jungled recesses for more than half a century. The fastest boats I could get seemed maddeningly slow for that race up the big river, and up the smaller, more turbulent stream. I was burning with impatience when I stepped off on the Sharpsville landing, with the last fifteen miles of my journey yet to make. It was past midnight, but I hurried to the livery stable where, by tradition half a century old, there is always a Buckner horse, day or night. As a sleepy black boy fastened the cinches, I turned to the owner of the stable, Joe Lafely, yawning and gaping in the light of the lantern he upheld. \"There are rumors of trouble on Tularoosa?\" He paled in the lantern-light. \"I don\'t know. I\'ve heard talk. But you people in Canaan are a shut-mouthed clan. No one outside knows what goes on in there—\" The night swallowed his lantern and his stammering voice as I headed west along the pike.', NULL);

It was my fortune to have access to his Nameless Cults in the original edition, the so-called Black Book, published in Dusseldorf in 1839, shortly before a hounding doom overtook the author. Collectors of rare literature were familiar with Nameless Cults mainly through the cheap and faulty translation which was pirated in London by Bridewall in 1845, and the carefully expurgated edition put out by the Golden Goblin Press of New York, 1909. But the volume I stumbled upon was one of the unexpurgated German copies, with heavy black leather covers and rusty iron hasps. I doubt if there are more than half a dozen such volumes in the entire world today, for the quantity issued was not great, and when the manner of the author\'s demise was bruited about, many possessors of the book burned their volumes in panic. Von Junzt spent his entire life (1795-1840) delving into forbidden subjects; he traveled in all parts of the world, gained entrance into innumerable secret societies, and read countless little-known and esoteric books and manuscripts in the original; and in the chapters of the Black Book, which range from startling clarity of exposition to murky ambiguity, there are statements and hints to freeze the blood of a thinking man. Reading what Von Junzt dared put in print arouses uneasy speculations as to what it was that he dared not tell. What dark matters, for instance, were contained in those closely written pages that formed the unpublished manuscript on which he worked unceasingly for months before his death, and which lay torn and scattered all over the floor of the locked and bolted chamber in which Von Junzt was found dead with the marks of taloned fingers on his throat? It will never be known, for the author\'s closest friend, the Frenchman Alexis Ladeau, after having spent a whole night piecing the fragments together and reading what was written, burnt them to ashes and cut his own throat with a razor.', NULL);

Here there is scarcely even a fisherman\'s hut within sight.\" \"The people shun the cairn as they have shunned it for centuries,\" I replied. \"Why?\" \"You\'ve asked me that before,\" I replied impatiently. \"I can only answer that they now avoid by habit what their ancestors avoided through knowledge.\" \"Knowledge!\" he laughed derisively. \"Superstition!\" I looked at him sombrely with unveiled hate.

They were tired, sick of bumping and pounding all day over woodland roads. The old deserted house stimulated their imagination with its suggestion of antebellum splendor and ultimate decay.

I know whereof I speak, for I was Niord. As I lie here awaiting death, which creeps slowly upon me like a blind slug, my dreams are filled with glittering visions and the pageantry of glory. It is not of the drab, disease-racked life of James Allison I dream, but all the gleaming figures of the mighty pageantry that have passed before, and shall come after; for I have faintly glimpsed, not merely the shapes that trail out behind, but shapes that come after, as a man in a long parade glimpses, far ahead, the line of figures that precede him winding over a distant hill, etched shadow like against the sky. I am one and all the pageantry of shapes and guises and masks which have been, are, and shall be the visible manifestations of that illusive, intangible, but vitally existent spirit now promenading under the brief and temporary name of James Allison. Each man on earth, each woman, is part and all of a similar caravan of shapes and beings. But they can not remember—their minds can not bridge the brief, awful gulfs of blackness which lie between those unstable shapes, and which the spirit, soul or ego, in spanning, shakes off its fleshy masks. I remember. Why I can remember is the strangest tale of all; but as I lie here with death\'s black wings slowly unfolding over me, all the dim folds of my previous lives are shaken out before my eyes, and I see myself in many forms and guises—braggart, swaggering, fearful, loving, foolish, all that men—have been or will be.', NULL);

He stood with booted legs wide, teetering slightly to the gentle lift of the lofty poop. He was bareheaded and his shirt was open, revealing his broad hairy chest. He emptied the flagon and tossed it over the side with a gusty sigh of satisfaction, then directed his somewhat blurred gaze on the deck below. From poop ladder to forecastle it was littered by sprawling figures. The ship smelt like a brewery. Empty barrels, with their heads stove in, stood or rolled between the prostrate forms. Vulmea was the only man on his feet. From galley-boy to first mate the rest of the ship\'s company lay senseless after a debauch that had lasted a whole night long. There was not even a man at the helm. But it was lashed securely and in that placid sea no hand was needed on the wheel. The breeze was light but steady. Land was a thin blue line to the east. A stainless blue sky held a sun whose heat had not yet become fierce. Vulmea blinked indulgently down upon the sprawled figures of his crew, and glanced idly over the larboard side. He grunted incredulously and batted his eyes. A ship loomed where he had expected to see only naked ocean stretching to the skyline. She was little more than a hundred yards away, and was bearing down swiftly on the Cockatoo, obviously with the intention of laying her alongside. She was tall and square-rigged, her white canvas flashing dazzlingly in the sun. From the maintruck the flag of England whipped red against the blue. Her bulwarks were lined with tense figures, bristling with boarding-pikes and grappling irons, and through her open ports the astounded pirate glimpsed the glow of the burning matches the gunners held ready. \"All hands to battle-quarters!\" yelled Vulmea confusedly. Reverberant snores answered the summons. All hands remained as they were. \"Wake up, you lousy dogs!\" roared their captain. \"Up, curse you! A king\'s ship is at our throats!\"', NULL);

An instant later an oil lamp with a broken chimney illuminated the saloon, throwing tense bearded faces into bold relief. The big lamp that hung from the ceiling was a smashed ruin; kerosene dripped from it to the floor, making an oily puddle beside a grimmer, darker pool. Two figures held the center of the room, under the broken lamp. One lay facedown, motionless arms outstretching empty hands. The other was crawling to his feet, blinking and gaping stupidly, like a man whose wits are still muddled by drink. His right arm hung limply by his side, a long-barreled pistol sagging from his fingers. The rigid line of figures along the bar melted into movement. Men came forward, stooping to stare down at the limp shape. A confused babble of conversation rose. Hurried steps sounded outside, and the crowd divided as a man pushed his way abruptly through. Instantly he dominated the scene. His broad-shouldered, trim-hipped figure was above medium height, and his broad-brimmed white hat, neat boots and cravat contrasted with the rough garb of the others, just as his keen, dark face with its narrow black mustache contrasted with the bearded countenances about him.

Also, it&rsquo;s one of my favorites. As it opens, Kane is fleeing from a band of cannibals when he discovers a devastated village and within it, a mutilated, yet still living man, tied to a stake. The village appears to have been attacked from above. One body hangs high up in a tree, impaled upon a branch. Continuing to evade his pursuers, he finds himself set upon by a winged creature with a manlike face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He barely survives that encounter, thanks only to the ministrations of people from the village of Upper Bogonda. That town has long been subject to the bloody depredations of a tribe of winged monsters. Seeing that Kane killed one of the creatures, they look to him for protection. Denying any of the divine power they perceive in him, as well as any real hope he can defend them, he pledges to stay with them nonetheless: &ldquo;Yet will I stay here in Bogonda all the rest of my life if ye think I be protection to the people.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an effort that ends in failure and madness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wings&rdquo; is bloody and savage, more so than any other of Howard&rsquo;s stories that come to mind. It shares with the Conan story, &ldquo;Beyond the Black River,&rdquo; a sense of inevitable doom, but it&rsquo;s far darker. That story revolves around colonists facing off against the indigenous tribes; here, villagers forlornly await their fates at the claws of sadistic creatures who view them as little more than cattle. Hundreds of innocents are torn apart, decapitated, or eaten alive. In the end, they all end up in the monsters&rsquo; bellies and Kane is a screaming madman. Kane may avenge the Bogondans, it does them no good and he&rsquo;s still mad.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-50340\" style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001-685x1024.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001-685x1024.jpg 685w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001-201x300.jpg 201w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001-768x1148.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001-600x897.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-wings-III-0001.jpg 1011w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p><em>He threw back his head to shriek his hate at the fiends above him and he felt warm, thick drops fall into his face, while the shadowy skies were filled with the screams of agony and the laughter of monsters. And Kane&rsquo;s last vestige of reason snapped as the sounds of that ghastly feast in the skies filled the night and the blood that rained from the stars fell into his face. He gibbered to and fro, screaming chaotic blasphemies.</em></p>\n<p><em>And was he not a symbol of Man, staggering among the tooth-marked bones and severed grinning heads of humans, brandishing a futile ax, and screaming incoherent hate at the grisly, winged shapes of Night that make him their prey, chuckling in demoniac triumph above him and dripping into his mad eyes the pitiful blood of their human victims?</em></p>\n<p>The story is a gripping, propulsive read that shows Howard&rsquo;s writing at its best. Before hitting the reader with monsteriffic action, he pulls you in with mystery and horror; who destroyed the village and why was the man bound to the post? At the same time, there&rsquo;s the implicit fear of the pursuing cannibals. From the first paragraphs, Howard starts building tension and keeps ratcheting it up until it has to explode. When the action comes, it&rsquo;s swift and sharp:</p>\n<p><em>The winged man had wrapped his limbs about the Englishman&rsquo;s legs and the talons he had driven into Kane&rsquo;s breast muscles held like fanged vices. The wolf-like fangs drove at Kane&rsquo;s throat, but the Puritan gripped the bony throat and thrust back the grisly head, while with his right hand he strove to draw his dirk. The birdman was mounting slowly and a fleeting glance showed Kane that they were already high above the trees. The Englishman did not hope to survive this battle in the sky, for even if he slew his foe, he would be dashed to death in the fall. But with the innate ferocity of the fighting man he set himself grimly to take his captor with him.</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img class=\"wp-image-50341\" style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-Wings_in_the_Night.04.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-Wings_in_the_Night.04.jpg 377w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-Wings_in_the_Night.04-225x300.jpg 225w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"301\" loading=\"lazy\"></div>\n<p>&ldquo;Wings in the Night&rdquo; also displays Howard&rsquo;s ease at world- and myth-building. The Bogondan priest, Goru, tells Kane the tragic tale of how his people came to be the flying monsters and the cannibals. At the same time, his story triggers in Kane an idea that the monsters might have links to even older stories reaching back to older legends from beyond the African shores. We also learn some of Kane&rsquo;s bloody past. The story doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum, but, instead, reads like a chapter from some longer work, set in a larger world of shadows and dangers that stretch far beyond the boundaries of its fifty pages. (Which, of course, is true &ndash; REH published five other Kane stories in his lifetime)</p>\n<p>My first encounter with Solomon Kane wasn&rsquo;t with one of the actual stories but in a comic book version. I picked up a small stack of&nbsp;<strong>The Savage Sword of Conan</strong>&nbsp;at a street fair. The Conan stories didn&rsquo;t do much for me &ndash; I&rsquo;m just not a fan of fur-loinclothed Conan &ndash; but in the back of issues 53 and 54 was something that grabbed me: writer Don Glut and artist David Wenzel&rsquo;s adaptation of &ldquo;Wings in the Night.&rdquo; It was gruesome and violent, and that was enough for me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was only when I picked up copies of the Bantam Solomon Kane collections,&nbsp;<strong>The Hills of the Dead</strong>, did I read Howard&rsquo;s own words. If the comic had impressed me, the real story gutted me. And it still does. Along with blood and thunder, the story has a brutal emotional core. If, somehow, you have missed out on Solomon Kane&rsquo;s adventures, get thee hence at once to a book-selling establishment.&nbsp;</p>', '2019-01-09T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_012822_1.jpg');

Tolkien had long resisted seeing his masterpiece printed in softcover, feeling it cheapened its literary importance. However, a loophole in US copyright law ostensibly meant the book was in the public domain in America and Ace Books produced an unauthorized paperback run of the trilogy. Tolkien was obviously upset and appealed to the fans of the story, whose efforts eventually forced Ace Books to cease publication of the books. However, the demand for Tolkien&rsquo;s work in paperback was clearly there and he acquiesced to the desires of the marketplace, authorizing Ballantine Books to publish&nbsp;<strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong>&nbsp;in the US.</p>\n<p>This introduction of an inexpensive paperback version revealed a hitherto untapped market for fantasy fiction and Ballantine Books immediately sought to cater to that market.

An agreement was struck with Carter, making him editor of the publishing company&rsquo;s new line, the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series. According to Carter&rsquo;s contract, he would choose works to be included in the line with Betty Ballantine, co-owner of Ballantine Books, having the final say as to which novels went to print.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BlueStar.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-25823\" style=\"display: block; margin: 8px auto 8px auto;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BlueStar-598x1024.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BlueStar-598x1024.jpg 598w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BlueStar-175x300.jpg 175w\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"855\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p>The first official Ballantine Adult Fantasy title was <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Star-Fletcher-Pratt-ebook/dp/B07FQZLMVP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Blue+Star+by+Fletcher+Pratt&amp;qid=1577561698&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\"><strong>The Blue Star</strong></a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_Pratt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fletcher Pratt (opens in a new tab)\">Fletcher Pratt</a>, first released in 1952, but debuting under the new line in May of 1969.

All totaled, six authors (seven if we count Tolkien who predated the Ballantine Series) from Adult Fantasy made their way onto Gygax&rsquo;s Appendix N<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;This may seem like a small percentage given Appendix N is comprised of twenty-nine authors, but considering many of those authors were either still in print (<a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/blog/2019/12/24/adventures-in-fiction-fritz-leiber-3/\">Leiber</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/blog/2019/12/17/adventures-in-fiction-michael-moorcock-2/\">Moorcock</a>, for example) or known predominantly for their science fiction work (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_G._Weinbaum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Weinbaum (opens in a new tab)\">Weinbaum</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/blog/2019/12/18/adventures-in-fiction-sterling-e-lanier-3/\">Lanier</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Brown (opens in a new tab)\">Brown</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/blog/2019/12/07/adventures-in-fiction-leigh-brackett-3/\">Brackett</a>, and even Vance) and not likely candidates for the Ballantine series, the overlap can&rsquo;t be dismissed as trivial.</p>\n<p>The books themselves are physical objects that warrant mentioning. Not only were the stories entertaining forays into the fantastic, but Ballantine&rsquo;s publishing efforts were top notch. One can still find copies of the series&rsquo; titles in second-hand stores in fantastic condition considering their paperback nature. The line&rsquo;s covers are just as enthralling as the stories: most of the cover art was the work of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervasio_Gallardo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Gervasio Gallardo (opens in a new tab)\">Gervasio Gallardo</a>, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://robertlogrippo.pixels.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Bob LoGrippo (opens in a new tab)\">Bob LoGrippo</a>&nbsp;also contributed to the line, his work adorning the covers of titles by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Machen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Arthur Machen  (opens in a new tab)\">Arthur Machen&nbsp;</a>and William Hope Hodgson.</p>\n<p>Many of the titles appearing in the Adult Fantasy Series are now readily available to fans of genre fiction.

Declining sales for some titles probably played a role despite the high popularity and the multiple reprinting of other works in the series. Ballantine Books was also purchased by Random House in 1973 and corporate business plans under the new ownership likely helped spell the line&rsquo;s demise.</p>\n<p>The Adult Fantasy Series titles remain popular with collectors&mdash;this author included&mdash;but the relatively large print runs mean that many of the books remain available at modest prices on the secondary market. The more popular titles, such as those by Clark Ashton Smith and H.P. Lovecraft demand high prices, however, so completists should be taken that into account before embarking on their collection efforts. While gamers young and old know of Appendix N, far fewer are aware of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series and its role in bringing some of the Appendix N authors&rsquo; works to prominence during the fantasy boom of the 1960s and 1970s. Without the Adult Fantasy Series, we might have never had an Appendix&nbsp;<strong>N</strong> to base fantasy role-playing on and the line should not be overlooked. Once you&rsquo;ve completed your Appendix N reading assignments, it&rsquo;s time to hit the online auction sites and brick-and-mortar second-hand bookstores and seek some Adult Fantasy titles. Your fantasy education&mdash;and your role-playing games&mdash;will be vastly improved by doing so.</p>', '2019-11-10T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_112220_2.jpg');

Putting aside the unbelievable idea that gamers may complain about things for the moment, we must realize that Appendix N is not a list one can argue with. It is a catalogue of all the literary influences Gygax chose to recognize as wellsprings from which&nbsp;<strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>&nbsp;flowed. Since it is representative of one man&rsquo;s work, we can&rsquo;t claim he made the error of excluding a particular author, even if we believe we can see their influence in the final product. Game design, like art, is a subjective process and one tends to see what one is inclined to see.</p>\n<p>While we cannot fault Gygax for not including certain names, we can, however, dig deeper into the authors he does list and examine where they drew their influences from. In the process, we discover that some of the names that people grumble about over their absence, are in fact representative in the works of those that are present. One of these influencers of the influencers is the third name from &ldquo;the big three of&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&rdquo;&mdash;Clark Ashton Smith.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12384\" style=\"float: left; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403-211x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403-211x300.jpg 211w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403-768x1094.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403-719x1024.jpg 719w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403-84x120.jpg 84w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403-600x855.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_tales_193403.jpg 951w\" alt=\"\" width=\"211\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p>Clark Ashton Smith is a name that has only recently begun to creep back into the consciousness of the fans of genre fiction. Despite his amazing productivity in such a short period&mdash;he wrote more than a hundred short stories in the &ldquo;weird fiction&rdquo; vein in only about five years&mdash;circumstance precluded him from enjoying the prolonged popularity and public recognition that his colleagues and constant correspondents Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard enjoyed.</p>\n<p>Unlike Lovecraft, Smith lacked the cadre of devoted fans and writers dedicated to keeping his work in print or expanding on the concepts he created. And whereas Howard&rsquo;s signature character of Conan the Cimmerian would captivate imaginations and be raised back into the public eye by the efforts of a devoted curator of his literary estate, Smith&rsquo;s massive body of work focused more on creating unique worlds where stories unfolded rather than reoccurring characters who adventured there. By the time Smith&rsquo;s work began to re-emerge thanks to the efforts of Lin Carter&rsquo;s editorship of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series line of paperbacks (Carter edited four anthologies of Smith&rsquo;s stories for that series between 1970 and 1973), the foundations of Gygax literary influences on&nbsp;<strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>&nbsp;were likely already set, their intellectual concrete cured. We can speculate this might be the reason for Smith&rsquo;s absence from Appendix N.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12382\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters-241x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters-241x300.jpg 241w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters-768x956.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters-822x1024.jpg 822w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters-90x112.jpg 90w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters-600x747.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CAS_HPL_Letters.jpg 1000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"241\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p>Clark Ashton Smith was born in California on January 13, 1893 and would remain a lifelong resident of the Golden State. He spent the majority of his life in Auburn, California, dwelling in a small cabin his parents erected. Smith lacked a complete public education, finishing only eight years of grammar school before pursuing his education at home, largely self-taught. This lack of formal education wouldn&rsquo;t hamper his literary career in the slightest, however.</p>\n<p>Smith attempted fiction writing in his youth, inspired by Poe and the Arabian Nights stories he read at home, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he turned his attention to poetry that he began to flourish as a writer. Smith met and became friends and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; to George Sterling, the noted California poet who was at the forefront of a Romantic revival at the time. Sterling encouraged Smith and the young poet enjoyed critical success with his first volume of verse,&nbsp;<strong>The Star-Treader and Other Poems</strong>. In 1920, Smith compose the long blank verse poem&nbsp;<strong>The Hashish Eater, or the Apocalypse of Evil</strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>The poem was read by H.P. Lovecraft who, in typical Lovecraftian epistolary proclivity, wrote the poet a fan letter. This missive began a correspondence that lasted until Lovecraft&rsquo;s death.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12385\" style=\"float: left; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209-193x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209-193x300.jpg 193w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209-768x1194.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209-658x1024.jpg 658w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209-77x120.jpg 77w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209-600x933.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/weird_3209.jpg 789w\" alt=\"\" width=\"193\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p>Smith might have gone on to world-wide renown as a poet had not economic forces intervened. In 1929, the stock market crashed, plunging the United States into the Great Depression. Smith, facing both widespread economic hardship and the need to support his aging and ailing parents, turned to fiction writing, a field only slightly more profitable than poetry. Many of these tales saw publication in the pulp magazine,&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>, which introduced his work to Robert E. Howard. Soon, Smith and Howard were enjoying a correspondence as well. The &ldquo;big three of&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&rdquo; exchanged letters constantly between 1933 and 1936, their ideas influencing on another and finding fertile ground in each other&rsquo;s imaginations. The god Tsathoggua, a creation of Smith&rsquo;s, was borrowed by Lovecraft in the story &ldquo;The Whisperer in Darkness,&rdquo; for example, and he in turned included references to the high priest &ldquo;Klarkash-Ton&rdquo; in another story.</p>\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s work was distinct from his compatriots, however. Whereas Lovecraft&rsquo;s work celebrated certain themes like cosmic horror and inhuman contamination and Howard was known for his memorable characters, Smith built worlds, weaving baroque word tapestries to describe places such as prehistoric Hyperborea, the far-flung realm of Zothique, a land at the end of Earth&rsquo;s prolonged death rattle, or the fictional French province of medieval Averoigne. He set many of his tales in these realms, places J.R.R. Tolkien would later describe as &ldquo;secondary worlds&rdquo;&mdash;coherent imaginary lands that would be the predecessors of the campaign worlds gamers later become intimately familiar with.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12383\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press-250x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press-250x300.jpg 250w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press-768x920.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press-90x108.jpg 90w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press-600x719.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nostalgia-of-the-unknown_1993_necronomicon-press.jpg 854w\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s weird fiction writing ceased almost as quickly as it began. The mid-1930s took a heavy toll on Smith. His mother died in 1935 and Robert E. Howard committed suicide in 1936, ending the exchange of letters between the&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;triumvirate for good. Both Lovecraft and Smith&rsquo;s father died in 1937, and with their passing, Smith&rsquo;s literary fire cooled to embers. For the remainder of his life, Smith&rsquo;s creative efforts were focused on poetry and the visual arts; he became an accomplished sculptor and artist. He died at the age of 68 on August 14, 1961, his ashes buried beneath a boulder not far from the small cabin his parents had built.</p>\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s roots in poetry are evident in his prose. He is a &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s writer,&rdquo; one with a deft command of vocabulary and no hesitation to use it. He employs language to describe his imaginary worlds in a method that is more akin to prose poetry than to the lines of the average pulp writer. To appreciate Smith, you have to give yourself over entirely to the sorcery of his sentences, willingly submit to his evocations of language. His writings are works of dense beauty, which might also account for his lack of overall popularity among genre fans. Smith&rsquo;s stories are not the blood and thunder of Howard&rsquo;s, and, while Lovecraft demonstrates a love for antiquated word play, his use of old words and British spelling is far and away different from the language mastery that Smith commands.</p>\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s work inspired a number of authors working contemporaneously and subsequently to the &ldquo;poet of Auburn&rsquo;s&rdquo; prolific period. In addition to his shared encouragements with Lovecraft and Howard, Smith&rsquo;s writing has been credited as influential by such esteemed genre writers as Harlan Ellison (who despite being a fan once described Smith&rsquo;s writing as &ldquo;prose so purple it sloshes over into ultraviolet. A writing style that would make Hemingway break out in hives.&rdquo;), Ray Bradbury, Jack Vance, Michael Moorcock, and Fritz Leiber (who not only paid a visit to Smith at his home but also incorporated the&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;luminary into his novel,&nbsp;<strong>Our Lady of Darkness</strong><em>).&nbsp;</em>Of the aforementioned authors, it&rsquo;s Smith&rsquo;s influence on Vance which leads us directly into the origins of&nbsp;<strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12381\" style=\"float: left; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique-181x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 181px) 100vw, 181px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique-181x300.jpg 181w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique-768x1273.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique-618x1024.jpg 618w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique-72x120.jpg 72w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique-600x994.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zothique.jpg 855w\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p>Among Smith&rsquo;s many literary worlds was that of Zothique. This setting for sixteen of his stories was the last inhabited continent on a far-future Earth. Zothique is, as Smith describes it, a world where &ldquo;The science and machinery of our present civilization have long been forgotten, together with our present religions. But many gods are worshipped; and sorcery and demonism prevail again as in ancient days.&rdquo; The Earth upon which Zothique lies is a weary one, and the Zothique cycle of stories are all in the Dying Earth genre. At least one writer and critic has claimed that Zothique owes its inspiration to William Hope Hodgson, another name from our Appendix N Archaeology, specifically Hodgson&rsquo;s novel,&nbsp;<strong>The Night Lands</strong><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s Zothique stories had a direct influence on Vance&rsquo;s The Dying Earth tales, stories which likewise occur as Earth is fading and &ldquo;sorcery and demonism&rdquo; have returned. Without Smith&rsquo;s creation, we might never have seen &ldquo;The Eyes of the Overworld&rdquo; and Vance&rsquo;s other Dying Earth tales. And without those, we have no &ldquo;Vancian magic&rdquo; to serve as the basis from spellcasting in&nbsp;<strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>. Smith&rsquo;s vision of a magical Earth at the end of time is therefore essential to the creation of the original fantasy role-playing game, regardless of whether Gygax was aware of Smith&rsquo;s work or not. (As an aside, I&rsquo;ll note that given Gary Gygax&rsquo;s love of florid writing and his own occasionally purple prose, I find it surprising that Gygax never spoke more exuberantly about Smith in later years).</p>\n<p>Of course, D&amp;D fans from a long ways back are already aware of a more direct intersection between the role-playing game and the work of Clark Ashton Smith. This conflux of ideas owes its being to Tom Moldvay, a designer whose own list of inspirational authors is not only larger than Gygax&rsquo;s (it can be found at the back of the&nbsp;<strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rulebook</strong>&nbsp;edited by him in 1981), but specifically mentions Smith. Moldvay also wrote the adventure,&nbsp;<em><strong>X2: Castle Amber (Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Amberville)</strong>,&nbsp;</em>further linking the&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;author and the game.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-12386\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber-236x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber-236x300.png 236w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber-768x977.png 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber-90x115.png 90w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber-600x764.png 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DnDX2CastleAmber.png 800w\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<p><strong>Castle Amber</strong><em>,&nbsp;</em>despite what one might think, has no connections to the work of Roger Zelazny, but does owe a debt to Smith&rsquo;s stories. The entire second half of the adventure is set in the realm of Averoigne, Smith&rsquo;s fictional French province. The party must contend with antagonists ripped directly from the pages of Smith&rsquo;s short stories (with permission of his literary estate), including &ldquo;The Colossus of Ylourgne,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Beast of Averoigne,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Enchantress of Sylaire.&rdquo; This marks Castle Amber as one of the few early licensed adaptations of genre fiction into role-playing game material, putting it in good company with Fritz Leiber&rsquo;s Nehwon, Robert Asprin&rsquo;s city of Sanctuary, and Michael Moorcock&rsquo;s Melnibon&eacute;.</p>\n<p><strong>Castle Amber</strong>&nbsp;is a &ldquo;funhouse&rdquo; dungeon of the old school, filled with numerous oddities, anachronisms, and random events, and one&rsquo;s opinion of it depends largely on the reader&rsquo;s own attitudes regarding those things. However, regardless of whether an entire generation of role-players enjoyed the module or not, for many it was the first time they ever heard the name &ldquo;Clark Ashton Smith.&rdquo; Much as&nbsp;<strong>Deities &amp; Demigods</strong>&nbsp;served to introduce gamers to the works of Fritz Leiber and Michael Moorcock,&nbsp;<strong>Castle Amber</strong>&nbsp;brought Smith&rsquo;s name into the awareness of a new, albeit smaller audience&mdash;myself included. Returning to the adventure and rereading it after becoming familiar with the stories Moldvay incorporates into the module is a fun experience. It might even change opinions about&nbsp;<strong>X2</strong>&nbsp;in some cases.</p>\n<p>While Smith has enjoyed something of a resurgence over the past decade, partly due to Night Shade Book&rsquo;s wonderful anthology series of all Smith&rsquo;s weird fiction stories, it&rsquo;s unlikely that he&rsquo;ll ever gain the popularity of Lovecraft or Howard. His fellow&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong> colleagues are both more accessible to the average reader (Howard more so than Lovecraft) and both have benefited from adaptations of their work into other media forms, notably motion pictures which serve to introduce the authors&rsquo; concepts and characters to a non-literary audience. Smith&rsquo;s work remains overlooked, which is a crime committed by popular culture on one hand, but which also makes those of us already familiar Clark Ashton Smith&rsquo;s stories feel fortunate we know what others don&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;ve never experienced Smith, consider this my invitation to join our close circle of privileged readers.</p>', '2019-12-11T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/appncashead.jpg');

Howard (1906-1936) was a giant and a father to giants, his literary creations so potent that they have informed&nbsp;popular culture and permeated mass consciousness down to the present day. But their very ubiquity can obscure and deceive &ndash; if two people strike up a conversation about Conan, are they actually talking about the same Conan? What&rsquo;s going on with all of these other writers penning stories of Howard&rsquo;s heroes, and do they need to be read in order? Out of the dozens of reprints and collections over the years, just where do you actually start?</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-37673\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/REH-colofon.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/REH-colofon.jpg 450w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/REH-colofon-219x300.jpg 219w\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"229\"></p>\n<p>Because Howard&rsquo;s creations are commercially valuable they have been distorted and, in my opinion, abused by various copyright holders, publishers, and editors over the years. While the full story of his publication history is well outside the purpose of this introductory essay (and not without plenty of bright spots to balance out some of the bad), there are a few salient points to keep in mind for the Howard novice. For one thing, differing copyright laws in various countries (specifically the US and the UK) sometimes mean that public domain versions of Howard&rsquo;s stories are available for free (or cheaply repackaged in ebooks of potentially dubious quality) &ndash; and sometimes they aren&rsquo;t. Often the stories are a less-than-desirable version. When it comes to many of the bargain basement editions of Howard, especially those in ebook, the old adage of you-get-what-you-pay-for applies in earnest.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-37675\" style=\"float: left; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/frazetta-01-conantheadventurer-614x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"293\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>There is also the confusion generated by the thriving Conan pastiche industry. Repackaging Conan over the years, presenting his story as a great epic complete with numbered volumes and an overall story arc, and ladling in a generous amount of filler stories penned by weaker writers or cobbled together out of unrelated and unpublished Howard stories (!), not only completely misrepresents the character, but raises a barrier of entry to the uninitiated. As a kid, I honestly thought I had to read the books in order, and since I&rsquo;d only come across a few random volumes &ndash; none of them marked with that magic number &lsquo;one&rsquo; &ndash; they just sat on my shelf, unread. Many assert that the deCamp and Carter pastiches opened the door to Conan for an entire generation of fans, and perhaps that&rsquo;s true &ndash; but in my own personal experience, the door was shut tight, and the knob wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</p>\n<p>But everything else is good news. Did that old Howard collection with the frazetta-esque fantasy cover unexpectedly turn out to be boxing stories? Well, at least they are some of the best ever written in the genre. Was that &lsquo;Conan&rsquo; story by Howard himself actually the tale of a 1930s pulp hero from Texas adventuring in the Middle East, with the guns swapped out for bows, and Afghans turned into Afgulis? Hey, it may not be true Conan, but it is good adventure fiction. As much as lesser talents interfered with the real thing, as much as the ticks flattered themselves that they were superior to the host, in the end the quality of Howard&rsquo;s work always won out.</p>\n<p><strong><img class=\"wp-image-37676\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rehdragon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\">So where to start?</strong>&nbsp;Conan is of course synonymous with Howard, and with sword-and-sorcery itself. And anyone generally interested in reading Howard for the first time, is probably more than likely thinking of giving his Conan stories a try. The first that I always recommend to beginners is&nbsp;<strong>The Hour of the Dragon</strong>&nbsp;(also published as&nbsp;<strong>Conan the Conqueror</strong>) the one and only Conan novel from Howard himself. This short novel has all of the pace, energy, and invention of Howard&rsquo;s magazine fiction, but in a longer adventure format that will feel more familiar to modern, novel-dominated reading habits. Howard even wrote the novel originally with a new audience in mind (the UK market), and it serves perfectly as an introduction to the character. Having lost his throne through trickery and treacherous sorcery, Conan goes on an epic quest that has him revisit the roles he occupied earlier in his career &ndash; pirate, reaver, mercenary, and thief. Everything that is hallmark to the Conan tales are found in this classic sword-and-sorcery novel.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hour of the Dragon/Conan the Conqueror</strong>&nbsp;has been published as a standalone volume over the years, but it is also included in the magnificent Del Rey line of Howard collections. Starting in 2005, Del Rey in the US began publishing first class collections of the unexpurgated Howard, following a trend begun by Wandering Star in the UK. These collections &ndash; currently at 11 volumes &ndash; feature the real, unadulterated Howard, his stories restored as close to the original published or unpublished versions as possible, and presented in the order in which they were written where applicable. Together with excellent supporting material from renowned genre scholars (including&nbsp;<strong>Tales From the Magician&rsquo;s Skull&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;very own Howard Andrew Jones), these volumes represent the absolute best entry into the world of Robert E. Howard.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-37674\" style=\"display: block; margin: 8px auto 8px auto;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books-1024x514.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books-300x151.jpg 300w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books-768x385.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books-319x160.jpg 319w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books-600x301.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/del-rey-conan-books.jpg 1036w\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>The first three volumes present all the Conan stories, subsequent books focus on other famous characters of Howard, such as Bran Mak Morn or Solomon Kane, or collect stories according to theme, such as Howard&rsquo;s horror tales and historical adventures. There are even a few &lsquo;Best Of&rsquo; volumes that take a more grab bag approach, for those readers looking for the sample platter rather than the entree. And while I firmly believe the Del Rey series to be the absolute best of collected Howard &ndash; not only is it affordable and easy to find, but it is the best presentation of his work outside of small press editions &ndash; it of course is not the only place to find these tales. Regardless of which editions of Howard&rsquo;s work you pick up, I&rsquo;d like to present a few more specific recommendations for new readers.</p>\n<p>In recommending specific Conan short stories, it&rsquo;s tempting to list about half of the entire cycle, they are just so many strong pieces. One of the greatest sword-and-sorcery stories ever written is &ldquo;The Tower of the Elephant,&rdquo; a pitch perfect fast paced caper that treats us to the young Cimmerian rogue out of step with civilized ways, and more fundamentally decent than you might expect of a savage. A grizzled King Conan shines in the very first Conan tale &ldquo;The Phoenix on the Sword,&rdquo; as well as the story that probably served as the blueprint for&nbsp;<strong>The Hour of the Dragon</strong>: &ldquo;The Scarlet Citadel.&rdquo; And if you liked the battle at the end of that one, you&rsquo;ll really love &ldquo;Black Colossus,&rdquo; where both Conan and Howard demonstrate a mastery of pitched warfare. Actually, it&rsquo;s almost a rule of thumb that if the word &lsquo;black&rsquo; is in the title, you&rsquo;re looking at top shelf Conan &ndash; &ldquo;Beyond the Black River&rdquo; is Howard&rsquo;s opus on civilization versus barbarism, &ldquo;The People of the Black Circle&rdquo; is a masterly novella with incredible pacing and a terrific villain, and &ldquo;The Queen of the Black Coast&rdquo; hits us with love and loss, as well as one of the most immortal sword-and-sorcery lines of all time:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let me live deep while I live; let me know the rich juices of red meat and stinging wine on my palate, the hot embrace of white arms, the mad exultation of battle when the blue blades flame crimson, and I am content.&rdquo;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-37679\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10fa3d4535afcf121e8d1466f0925c06.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10fa3d4535afcf121e8d1466f0925c06.jpg 564w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10fa3d4535afcf121e8d1466f0925c06-219x300.jpg 219w\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Other Howard heroes would not echo the above sentiment, and anyone suggesting they are clones of one another just isn&rsquo;t paying attention. Both Bran Mak Morn and King Kull, Howard&rsquo;s two other major sword-and-sorcery protagonists, are kings with a heavy doom laid upon them. Get a taste for both in the crossover story &ldquo;Kings of the Night,&rdquo; or journey through the dark side of Romano-Britain with Bran alone in one of the finest stories Howard would ever produce, &ldquo;The Worms of the Earth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-37680\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/delrey-swordwoman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\">Howard also wrote historical adventure stories in the vein of popular tales from magazines like&nbsp;<strong>Argosy</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Adventure</strong>. Many of the best are set in the backdrop of the Crusader period, where West and East collide in colorful conflict, such as in &ldquo;The Sowers of the Thunder,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Hawks of Outremer.&rdquo; Or meet the real Red Sonya, a heroine who never once wore a chain mail bikini, not least of all because she&rsquo;s living and fighting during the 16th century Siege of Vienna in &ldquo;The Shadow of the Vulture.&rdquo; And speaking of kick-butt heroines done right, you definitely won&rsquo;t forget meeting Dark Agnes de Chastillon in &ldquo;The Sword Woman.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps easy to get the wrong idea about Howard&rsquo;s fiction when you haven&rsquo;t experienced the real thing, only the pop culture reflection, but the above basics certainly make for a great place to start. Howard&rsquo;s output was broad, and it was vast &ndash; I&rsquo;m not even mentioning his westerns, his humorous stories, his boxing yarns, or his poetry. Or how about &ldquo;Pigeons From Hell,&rdquo; an absolute classic of the horror genre. His possibly posthumously-finished sword-and-planet novel,&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>? The El Borak adventures? And, I also have to point out that some of the Howard pastiche is actually quite good, so there really is a whole world of non-Howard Howard out there to discover as well.</p>\n<p>No need to overwhelm new readers, the above taste is plenty. And once you&rsquo;ve tried Howard, you certainly won&rsquo;t need me to hold the door open for you any longer &ndash; you&rsquo;ll shove me out of the way and kick it down yourself, just as any good barbarian would.</p>', '2020-02-12T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rehstarthead.jpg');

Howard is a member of that select group of authors whose very name has become adjectival &ndash; a Howardian story is violent, two-fisted adventure in which theme and forward motion are paramount, outsider heroes are fierce yet noble, and physical and mental toughness represent the highest virtues. Howard&rsquo;s own stories are also rollicking good escapist fiction written with more ingenuity and care than much that was produced by his imitators, even when he, himself, was laboring in another&rsquo;s shadow.&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>, Howard&rsquo;s posthumously published short planetary adventure novel, is a great example of this. Though it is clearly charging headlong down the well-trodden path of Edgar Rice Burroughs&rsquo; Mars books,&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t read like Burroughs pastiche, indeed it goes beyond even the somewhat apt-but-too-pat &lsquo;Conan on Barsoom&rsquo; tagline to stand apart as its own thing: Howardian sword-and-planet.</p>\n<p>Stop me if you&rsquo;ve heard this one before: extraordinarily capable loner misfit warrior fleeing certain destruction miraculously escapes to colorful planet of adventure and ascends to benign dominance by virtue of his prowess and essential decency. It&rsquo;s of course&nbsp;<strong>A Princess of Mars</strong>&nbsp;and the dozens of science fantasy books that pay homage to it but, reshuffle or remove a few of the elements, say the radium pistols, the six-limbed Tharks, and the crimson-skinned beauties, and you&rsquo;ve more-or-less got another Burroughs classic,&nbsp;<strong>Tarzan</strong>. But it&rsquo;s even bigger than those, it&rsquo;s the modern uber-myth of the nineteenth and twentieth century West, it&rsquo;s everything from&nbsp;<strong>King Solomon&rsquo;s Mines</strong>&nbsp;to T. E. Lawrence,&nbsp;<strong>Robinson Crusoe</strong>&nbsp;to Gordon of Khartoum. Until the zombie apocalypse replaced it, it was the dominant modern myth, and the baseline of much of adventure fiction &ndash; the capable modern man testing his mettle in a part of the world, or solar system, to which he was not native.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The average civilized man is never fully alive &hellip; Life flickers feebly in him; his senses are dull and torpid. In developing his intellect he has sacrificed far more than he realizes.&rdquo; Meet Esau Cairn, &ldquo;the most perfectly developed man on Earth,&rdquo; a man not merely at odds with his time, but &ldquo;born outside his epoch.&rdquo; If John Carter&rsquo;s superpower is a musculature developed in Earth-normal gravity, Esau Cairn&rsquo;s is that he is an atavism &ndash; a man stronger, fiercer, faster, and more rageful than the normal members of the civilization he was born into. It&rsquo;s not enough to say Esau Cairn is a man&rsquo;s man, he&rsquo;s Cro-Magnon man&rsquo;s man.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-39307\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric-680x1024.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric-199x300.jpg 199w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric-600x904.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2almuric.jpg 1009w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>He is also among the most Howardian of heroes. While John Carter evades an Apache war party, Cairn flees a corrupt and unjust system, having been used by venal politicos until he got wind of the deception and broke a villain&rsquo;s skull with his fist. Like Carter among the Tharks, Cairn achieves respect and authority among the Guras, but only after he has first endured a period of total primitivism. Arriving on the fabulous world of Almuric in about as convincing a way as Carter is transported to Barsoom, Cairn beats the first man he meets unconscious over an insult and retreats to the wilds, to undergo a savage purification.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was living the life of the most primitive savage; I had neither companionship, books, clothing, nor any of the things which go to make up civilization.&rdquo; Nor, indeed, at this point does Cairn even have fire&nbsp; &ndash; he gulps his meat raw, and gathers a bounty of fruit and nuts from the Almurician countryside. He is hardened by privation, exposure, and constant danger. He finds himself in a world something like the African savanna, where he must compete with dangerous fauna analogous to beasts we are familiar with: hyenas, bears, giant boars, and sabertooth cats. His only tool is a knife taken off the first Gura, a ferocious apelike man, he meets within moments of appearing on Almuric. And for the reader, that Gura, and a few other oddities offhandedly mentioned in the narrative, are the only hints we get &ndash; at this stage &mdash; of the kind of sense of wonder weirdness one expects from this kind of fiction. While Burroughs blasts the audience with a &lsquo;we&rsquo;re not in Kansas anymore&rsquo; scene as soon as his hero sets foot on extraterrestrial soil, Howard may as well have transported Cairn to a remote part of our own world, or back in time to the neolithic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Which serves the theme of&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>&nbsp;very well &ndash; this is not just about a picaresque adventure through a land of fabulous adventure, it&rsquo;s about Howard&rsquo;s own great subject and fixation, the freedom of the natural life, the triumph of the barbarian. It&rsquo;s escapist, but so is Burroughs and every other pulp writer. It&rsquo;s an unrealistic portrait of noble savages possessed of a tiger&rsquo;s ferocity and a schoolboy&rsquo;s diffidence toward woman, but that&rsquo;s because no one would be entertained by the truly barbaric presented in all of its ugly wholeness. And Howard isn&rsquo;t wrong when he points out the faults of the civilized, his view, Cairn&rsquo;s view, Conan&rsquo;s view, isn&rsquo;t naive because it&rsquo;s idealized, any more than the sins of the savage disprove his virtues &ndash; or excuse those of modern man.</p>\n<p>If Cairn could be said to have a sin it would be pride &ndash; he&rsquo;s reminiscent of Conan in the Maul of Zamora, content to turn away from conflict until his person is mishandled, and then he&rsquo;s transformed into an avatar of murder. Cairn himself is perfectly agreeable until insulted or interfered with, in fact the first person, or Gura, he meets unknowingly insults Cairn by asking if he&rsquo;s a woman, and the two come to violent blows. It&rsquo;s the first of many battles in&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>, and it sets up not only a villain that will return to haunt Cairn later, but hints at the unusual sexual dimorphism of the Guras themselves &ndash; the men of their race are shaggy, apelike, and brutish, whereas their woman are indistinguishable from those of Earth, save being even more beautiful and less independent. Imagine a&nbsp;<em>Planet of the Apes</em> where Nova is the daughter of Dr. Zaius.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3almuric.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-39306\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3almuric.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3almuric.jpg 286w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3almuric-181x300.jpg 181w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>Of course, the Guras have nothing like Orangutan theologian-scientists in their midst &ndash; their material culture is simple and wholly practical, their society static, an &ldquo;exuberant barbarism&rdquo; and rigidly hierarchical, geared wholly for hunting and war. They possess the same touchy honor that Cairn has, and regardless of whether it stems from the code of the Southern Gentleman or the interpersonal&nbsp;<em>agon</em>&nbsp;of the Homeric heroes, it is a Howard staple. They are crude, brutal, but mostly without malice or scheming, and universally chivalrous when it comes to protecting their lady-folk. Guras are Noble Savages, one part ferocious apeman, the other part demurring damsel. Cairn has found not only a perfect world to test his mettle, but a perfect people to call his own.</p>\n<p>This is all the stuff of wish fulfillment fantasy, the sort of thing that lesser authors can&rsquo;t handle for fear of embarrassment, but that nevertheless beats strongly at the heart of the best pulp fiction &ndash; or Medieval lay, or Ancient Epic, or legend from the dawn of time. Cairn&rsquo;s strength, persistence, and heroism see him adopted by a Gura tribe; that plus his no doubt boyish good looks and stranger&rsquo;s exoticism wins him the heart of Altha, a beautiful Gura lass who is a bit of a mirror of Cairn, having something more akin to &ldquo;Earthlike&rdquo; sensibilities in much the same way that Cairn himself seems more of a natural fit for&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>. She, of course, gets captured &mdash; not once but thrice &ndash; and Cairn flys (literally) to the rescue.</p>\n<p>The Yagas are the weird menace of the piece, a wickedly evil race of bat-winged flying humanoids that prey upon all of the peoples of Almuric. They capture Altha, and Cairn too, and take them to &ldquo;the black citadel of Yugga, on the rock Yuthla, by the river Yogh, in the land of Yagg.&rdquo; The language rolls biblical, the villains themselves are demonic &ndash; and civilized. Their fortress is alive with the screams of their slaves as the black-hearted, cannibalistic Yagas devise tortures and depravities to banish the ennui of their empty days. Yasmeena, their Queen, possesses the cruel perfect &ldquo;beauty of a soulless statue,&rdquo; and she keeps Cairn in golden chains, fascinated by her new plaything, a man like no other she has ever seen. She asks him about the beliefs of the Guras, and scoffs at their notions of Valhalla:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Stupid pigs. Death is oblivion. We Yagas worship only our own bodies. And to our bodies we make rich sacrifices with the bodies of the foolish little people.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t have to travel as far as Almuric to hear echoes of such nihilism in our own world, the dark inversion of the healthy physicality of the barbarian. Cairn, for all his power and physical perfection, is tempered by a noble and caring soul. The Yagas are purely materialistic, architects of a &ldquo;thousand ages of cruelty and oppression,&rdquo; and value both power and cruelty for its own sake. They even clip the wings of their woman at birth, their impulse to control the flip-side of the Gura&rsquo;s impulse to protect their wives and daughters behind cyclopean walls of green stone. Only the Yaga Queens, most wicked and terrible of all, retain the ability to fly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4almuric.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-39312\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4almuric.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"></a>Yasmeena&rsquo;s temptation of Cairn fails, and our hero escapes to lead the united clans of Guras in a climactic castle-storming that rescues the slaves of the Yagas, among them Cairn&rsquo;s love Altha, and breaks the cruel reign of the winged men forever. It&rsquo;s a perfect blood and thunder final act to a pulp engine of invention that had been racing along since the first scene. Certainly, some of the excesses of pulp fiction, the hasty writing and purple prose, the formula, the too-convenient or too-coincidental plot elements can be found in&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>, and anyone that wants to make issues with these can happily shoot fish in a barrel all they like. But, in our own modern parlance, I&rsquo;d argue many of these things are a feature, not a bug. In the hands of someone of less skill, the flaws stand out &ndash; in the hands of a master, the flaws only serve to reinforce the aesthetic of the whole. Robert E. Howard certainly was a master of telling stories that people want to be immersed in, of pounding out a pace that rushes forward with a kind of surefooted near-recklessness toward a satisfying catharsis, and of putting his own Howardian stamp on everything he touched.</p>\n<p>But, and there&rsquo;s a but, how much of&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong>&nbsp;is actually Howard&rsquo;s work? The novel was originally serialized in&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;for posthumous publication and it was based on a combination of unfinished drafts. It did always seem strange that Cairn intended to &ldquo;instill some of the culture of my native planet into this erstwhile savage people&rdquo; at the rather too-happily-ever-after close of the story. Isn&rsquo;t the culture of his native world exactly what Cairn was at odds with? And the breathless climax of the novel is where things start to feel slap-dash at times, although still presented in a coherent and terrifically explosive scene. Were these passages simply fleshed out from a sketchy outline by Howard, perhaps by&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;editor Farnsworth Wright himself? The question of who finished Howard&rsquo;s draft is probably not one that will ever have a definitive answer; most have assumed it was Otis Adelbert Kline, Howard&rsquo;s agent and literary executor, himself an author of adventure fiction and several sword-and-planet novels (<strong>The Swordsman of Mars</strong>). Howard scholar Morgan Holmes suggests the prolific Otto Binder as the most likely candidate in his article &ldquo;The First Posthumous Collaborator&rdquo; in the Dec 2008 issue of&nbsp;<strong>The Cimmerian.</strong></p>\n<p>So perhaps some of those flaws in&nbsp;<strong>Almuric</strong> really have more to do with it not being properly finished and polished over by Howard himself, which only serves to further tantalize fans who&rsquo;d like to think of all those lost wonders he might have lived to produce. But what is here, the brutal fast-paced action, the outsider more at home among beasts and brawlers, the sinister nature of organized power, is pure Howard, even if it doesn&rsquo;t always live up to the best of his output.</p>', '2020-08-14T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_021921_2.jpg');

Howard’s “The Tower of the Elephant”\n', '<p><em>&ldquo;Civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split, as a general thing.&rdquo;<br></em>&ndash; Robert E. Howard, &ldquo;The Tower of the Elephant&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The above is one of the most famous lines Robert E. Howard ever wrote, and it occurs as a young, somewhat naive Conan is mocked by a group of city dwellers in the opening scene of &ldquo;The Tower of the Elephant.&rdquo; As an introduction to both the story itself, and the character and themes of Conan in general, that opening scene is perhaps unsurpassed in the overall saga. Indeed in this, the fourth Conan story Howard wrote, everything that is indicative of the series is on display and firing on all cylinders &ndash;&nbsp; exotic cosmopolitan settings, ferocious action, weird sorcery, a sense of deep time history, propulsive pacing, and a stark contrast between the barbarian and the civilized man.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-tower-climb.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-38566\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-tower-climb.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-tower-climb.jpg 474w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-tower-climb-228x300.jpg 228w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"296\"></a>One of those civilized men is a fat Kothian slaver whom Conan engages in conversation, curious about the secret of the Elephant Tower that dominates the city of Zamora, a secret in the form of a jewel of incomparable value. The slaver mocks the young Conan&rsquo;s ignorance, and also his confidence, and Conan is a bit slow on the uptake as the Zamoran thieves surrounding them join in on the fun. Our Cimmerian gets the hint and is ready to walk away when the Kothian fool just has to take things one step too far and pushes him. Conan proceeds to Conan, and the &lsquo;woman-stealer&rsquo; gets his final etiquette lesson in the form of a bellyful of blade steel. In this one scene we have the essential nature of Conan contrasted with city swine he encounters, we get hints about the mysterious Elephant Tower and its black-hearted occupant, but we also get a thematic set up for the climax of the story. It isn&rsquo;t a shifty thief, or a venal merchant, or a brutal mercenary that Conan kills, but one who enslaves others to enrich himself. The Kothian slaver is the ant-scale reflection of the ancient evil that is Yara, master of the Tower, proof the sins of a civilization that yokes and coerces those within its power echoes through all levels of its hierarchy of exploitation. Our noble savage, unburdened by philosophy or the civilized world&rsquo;s religion, reacts with a disgust that demonstrates his intrinsic decency.</p>\n<p>But Conan is a mere fledgling in Zamora, not only perplexed by the ways of the city, but relatively untutored in his profession of thief. The next civilized man he encounters is in the very gardens of the Tower itself: Taurus of Nemedia, Prince of Thieves. He&rsquo;s an extraordinarily memorable character despite his very short appearance in the saga. Taurus is strong and nimble like Conan, but he&rsquo;s also got a head full of experience and a bag full of tricks. When Conan suggests Taurus has made a mistake by leaving the body of a guard out in the open, the latter quickly explains the method to his madness. To scale the slick-sided round tower with sides like polished glass, Taurus has what may well be a magic rope. To take care of the silent lions of the garden, he has the lethal powder of the yellow lotus. But Conan has something too, something that no one else the length and breadth of the entire saga has. In a much later story, &ldquo;A Witch Shall Be Born,&rdquo; Conan himself comes close to saying just what that is, what elemental force flows through him as a being more in tune with nature, more natural and instinctual in his every act, than any flaccid denizen of the city, when he explains to the man who had (literally) crucified him and whom he, in turn, has crucified: &ldquo;you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus when the lion of the garden that had not died from Taurus&rsquo; poison cloud springs like murderous lighting at the two as they contemplate climbing the wall, only Conan&rsquo;s reflexes, his un-dulled instincts, save them. Taurus, who seems to admire Conan&rsquo;s pluck in having simply decided on a whim to undertake a theft that the Prince of Thieves himself had spent months preparing for, is stunned, for the Cimmerian is something other than merely skilled, his very life&rsquo;s rhythm beats outside the bounds thought possible by even the most accomplished and hardened of civilized men.</p>\n<p>And this revelation is immediately reinforced when the two achieve the Tower&rsquo;s top, and Taurus slips ahead inside, only to stagger back out again and drop cold dead. We can never really know if the Nemedian had intended to betray Conan in this moment &ndash; the latter&rsquo;s suspicions may have been founded, or they may be a sign that the young savage is quickly learning the habit of distrust born of his new environment &ndash; but the result of course is to set up suspense for the next encounter. It also further reinforces the theme of the difference between Conan and everyone else. The civilized men in the Maul laughed at the very notion of breaking into Yara&rsquo;s tightly guarded, mysterious tower. The best thief the civilized world has produced made the attempt after meticulous preparation and a lifetime of experience &ndash; and he dies simply opening a door.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-tower-spider.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-38568\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-tower-spider.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-tower-spider.jpg 474w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-tower-spider-221x300.jpg 221w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>Beyond the door is a fabulous treasure room, and the deadly giant spider that slew Taurus. The ensuing fight is top notch tense action, in which the man with animal instincts and the beast with the low-cunning of a human engage in move and countermove from which Conan barely emerges unscathed. While outside in the garden Conan faced creatures of this world, here, in a wizard&rsquo;s tower, we get our first real taste of the uncanny in a foe that comes closer to killing the Cimmerian than any other in the story.</p>\n<p>This uncanny encounter sets up the penultimate and central scene of &ldquo;The Tower of the Elephant&rdquo;, Conan&rsquo;s discovery of the true secret of the Elephant Tower. For there, locked in its heart, the impossible form of the elephant-headed giant that Conan at first assumes to be a bizarre and exotic idol, turns out to be an imprisoned and abused being of another world, a long-lived, powerful alien who has been tortured for his secrets and forced to use his powers for Yara. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That he did not instantly explode in a burst of murderous frenzy is a fact that measures his horror, which paralyzed him where he stood. A civilized man in his position would have sought doubtful refuge in the conclusion that he was insane; it did not occur to the Cimmerian to doubt his senses.&rdquo; No Lovecraftian protagonist he, whose bow tie might fly off at the first sight of a tentacle or some non-Euclidean geometry, no; Conan stays sane even when overwhelmed. He regains his senses:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Conan&rsquo;s gaze strayed to the limbs stretched on the marble couch. And he knew the monster would not rise to attack him. He knew the marks of the rack, and the searing brand of the flame, and tough-souled as he was, he stood aghast at the ruined deformities which his reason told him had once been limbs as comely as his own. And suddenly all fear and repulsion went from him, to be replaced by a great pity. What this monster was, Conan could not know, but the evidences of its sufferings were so terrible and pathetic that a strange aching sadness came over the Cimmerian, he knew not why. He only felt that he was looking upon a cosmic tragedy, and he shrank with shame, as if the guilt of a whole race were laid upon him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Here is Cosmic Horror flipped on its head &ndash; humanity, still insignificant in this equation but oblivious to and uncaring of the implications of that &ndash; abuses and parasitizes the fantastic alien other and perverts it to its own cruel, petty, tyrannical will. It is Yara, a priest, who has done this &ndash; Yara who studied at the foot of the Elephant God before enslaving it, who learned the wondrous secrets of history and time that Conan only receives a mere whiff of, but whose thirst for power drives him to enslave and torture. Conan&rsquo;s instincts again come into play &ndash; but not to fight, not to dodge a spider&rsquo;s sticky strand or to wheel on an unseen assailant. No, it&rsquo;s his instinct for decency that bypasses all thought or reason, and the barbarian does what the suffering ancient asks of him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-sanjulian-trower-elepahnt.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-38567\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-sanjulian-trower-elepahnt.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-sanjulian-trower-elepahnt.jpg 736w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-sanjulian-trower-elepahnt-219x300.jpg 219w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-sanjulian-trower-elepahnt-600x820.jpg 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>This is the ultimate act of the Noble Savage, the final demonstration of the difference between Conan and those who would call themselves his betters. No doubt Taurus would have taken the jewel beyond price from the Tower and escaped &ndash; Conan assists the enslaved being in freeing itself, and in exacting justice from its tormentor. The deaths Conan has caused that evening are something the Elephant God himself sees, knowing there is blood on Conan&rsquo;s hands, and those acts themselves almost feel as if they were part of a ritual progression that lead from the winesinks of the Maul to the heart of the Elephant Tower &ndash; Conan kills man, then beast, then monster and, finally, god.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But this final act of killing isn&rsquo;t a boss-battle combat, instead it is an act of mercy and liberation. Cutting the heart from the alien, Conan bathes the fabulous jewel of power in the creature&rsquo;s blood, which it absorbs like a sponge. Presenting the jewel to Yara &ndash; the third and final civilized man Conan encounters in this story &mdash; he utterly destroys the vile priest, the villain shrinking away into the microscopic as his stolen power is returned to the jewel. The radiant Elephant Being &ndash; for he truly is no god, in his own words, but nor is he something we can understand &ndash; is reborn to ascend once again on cosmic wings. The jewel is destroyed, the tower is destroyed, and the penniless wanderer in a loincloth departs no richer than when he came.</p>\n<p>No richer, that is, in terms of jewels or gold, none of which ever stay in Conan&rsquo;s hands for very long, anyway. This fast-paced story of an imaginative heist turns out to be even more than it first appears, verging almost on a parable of a young man navigating an impure world and choosing to remain true to his humanity.

In this sub-genre I would classify books like &ldquo;The Worm Ouroboros,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jurgen,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Once and Future King,&rdquo; the Grey Mouser/Fafhrd series, the Conan series, &ldquo;The Broken Sword,&rdquo; &ldquo;Well of the Unicorn,&rdquo; etc., usw.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, in the same essay Moorcock began refining these broad parameters, focusing on a subset of fantasy stories &ldquo;which could hardly be classified as SF, and they are stories of high adventure, generally featuring a central hero very easy to identify oneself with &hellip;. tales told for the tale&rsquo;s sake&hellip; rooted in legendry, classic romance, mythology, folklore, and dubious ancient works of &ldquo;History.&rdquo; These were quest stories, Moorcock added, in which the hero is thwarted by villains but against all odds does what the reader expects of him. He chose to exclude &ldquo;alternate space-time continuum&rdquo; stories, like Mark Twain&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>A Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</strong>, on the grounds that they lacked sufficient seriousness. In short, he was working out the parameters of a yet-to-be named subgenre. While he advocated for the term &ldquo;epic fantasy,&rdquo; nevertheless he was speaking of a nascent form of S&amp;S:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>So, all in all, I would say that Epic Fantasy is about the best name for the sub-genre, considering its general form and roots. Obviously, Epic Fantasy includes the Conan, Kull, and Bran Mak Morn stories of R E Howard; the Grey Mouser/Fafhrd stories by Fritz Leiber; the Arthurian tetralogy by T.H. White; the Middle Earth stories of J.R.R Tolkien; &ldquo;The Worm Ouroboros&rdquo; by E R Eddison; the Zothique stories of Clark Ashton Smith; some of the works of Abraham Merrit (&ldquo;The Ship of Ishtar&rdquo;, etc.); some of H Rider Haggard&rsquo;s stories (&ldquo;Alan and the Ice Gods&rdquo;, etc.); &ldquo;The Broken Sword&rdquo; by Poul Anderson; the Gormenghast trilogy of Mervyn Peake (it just gets in, I think); the Poictesme stories of James Branch Cabell (including &ldquo;Jurgen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silver Stallion,&rdquo; and others) and &ldquo;The Well of the Unicorn&rdquo; by Fletcher Pratt. I would appreciate other suggestions for possible inclusions. &ldquo;Titus Groan&rdquo; and its sequels by Mervyn Peake actually do not have the form nor roots I have described but they have the general atmosphere and are certainly set outside of our own space-time Earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-amra.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-45817\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-amra.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-amra.jpg 318w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-amra-213x300.jpg 213w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>He was engaging in a process of sifting, and refinement.</p>\n<p>Next came Leiber&rsquo;s famous reply to Moorcock. In a letter in the pages of the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society newsletter&nbsp;<strong>Ancalagon</strong>&nbsp;(issue #2, April 1961), Leiber suggested for the first time that &ldquo;sword-and-sorcery&rdquo; be considered:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>ANCALAGON looks nice, especially the cover (where the art seems nicely gauged to the method of reproduction) and the article on fantasy-adventure&mdash;a field which I feel more certain than ever should be called the sword-and-sorcery story. This accurately describes the points of culture-level and supernatural element and also immediately distinguishes it from the cloak-and-sword (historical adventure) story&mdash;and (quite incidentally) from the cloak-and-dagger (international espionage) story too! The word sorcery implies something more and other than historical human witchcraft, so even the element of an alien-yet-human world background is hinted at. At any rate I&rsquo;ll use sword-and-sorcery as a good popular catchphrase for the field. It won&rsquo;t interfere with the use of a more formal designation of the field (such as the &ldquo;non-historical fantasy adventure&rdquo; which Sprague once suggested in a review of Smith Abominations of Yondro in AMRA) when one comes along or is finally settled on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leiber here added further delineation, to fictional cultures whose warriors wield swords instead of guns, and include magical elements, to separate S&amp;S from historical adventure. His letter to&nbsp;<strong>Anacalagon</strong>&nbsp;was reprinted in the July 1961&nbsp;<strong>Amra</strong>, with some amendments, and the term &ldquo;sword-and-sorcery&rdquo; stuck.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-swords-lankhmar.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-45818\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-swords-lankhmar-609x1024.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-swords-lankhmar-609x1024.jpeg 609w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-swords-lankhmar-178x300.jpeg 178w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-swords-lankhmar-600x1009.jpeg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-swords-lankhmar.jpeg 700w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"378\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>Seven years later Leiber would continue this process of sifting and refinement in the introduction to&nbsp;<strong>The Swords of Lankhmar</strong>&nbsp;(1968), making it clear he was at something grittier and more grounded than high fantasy in his tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Fafhrd and the Mouser are rogues through and through, though each has in him a lot of humanity and at least a diamond chip of the spirit of true adventure. They drink, they feast, they wench, they brawl, they steal, they gamble, and surely they hire out their swords to powers that are only a shade better, if that, than the villains. It strikes me (and something might be made of this) that Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are almost at the opposite extreme from the heroes of Tolkien.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Shake, re-evaluate.</em></p>\n<p>A dozen years after the famous Moorcock/Leiber exchange, the refinement continued. Lin Carter in the introduction to&nbsp;<strong>Flashing Swords #1</strong>(1973) connected S&amp;S back to the pulps, creating a through-line to where this type of fantasy started:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>What does Sword &amp; Sorcery mean? A succinct definition follows: We call a story Sword &amp; Sorcery when it is an action tale, derived from the traditions of the pulp magazine adventure story, set in a land, age or world of the author&rsquo;s invention&ndash;a milieu in which magic actually works and the gods are real&mdash;a story, moreover, which pits a stalwart warrior in direct conflict with the forces of supernatural evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Sift, sift</em>.</p>\n<p>In the 70s and into the 80s the refinement continued, but mainly toward rigidity. The holes through which sword-and-sorcery could pass grew smaller until by the 80s it was seemingly only barbarians. S&amp;S had become stagnant and fixed, which led to its commercial demise. It sat largely moribund through the 90s, until new artists came along, preceded by new ideas about what the subgenre could include, and renewed debates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Re-evaluation and refinement are part of the process that allow genres to stay healthy and vital, not fixed, rigid forms in which only stale repetition is possible. The lesson? Instead of envisioning S&amp;S as a formula, consider instead a mesh, or perhaps a funnel, wide at one end and narrow at the other. With that metaphor the question becomes: How fine is your definition, and what will you allow to pass through, or be caught and considered, and treasured?</p>', '2021-07-16T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_091721_1.jpg');

It isn&rsquo;t bound by in-group jargon, or require some esoteric knowledge to appreciate &ndash; indeed, Murphy fills in all the gaps for you, not only providing a coherent narrative for the whole history of the field, but numerous sidebar asides that illuminate everything from finer points of literary analysis to sword-and-sorcery&rsquo;s influence on Heavy Metal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-36896\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ShaodwKingdom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\">Organized chronologically, with chapters focused on discreet periods such as the heyday of the&nbsp;<em>Weird Tales</em>&nbsp;era or the boom years of the 60s and 70s that saw sword-and-sorcery elevated to near-ubiquity in not only the publishing world but in all of pop culture,&nbsp;<strong>Flame and Crimson</strong>&nbsp;also manages to provide mini literary biographies for the major figures of each period, along with critical analysis of their important works, and controversies literary or otherwise that arose in these times. Murphy doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to make his own assertions on various points, giving us the benefit of his curatorial taste and broad knowledge in his recommendations of major works and artists. He is also happy to make definite claims backed by well-reasoned argument, such as labeling Howard&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shadow Kingdom&rdquo; as the first true sword-and-sorcery story, demonstrating the useful division of the genre&rsquo;s protagonists into the categories of heroic and anti-heroic, and crediting Frank Frazetta&rsquo;s elementally arresting artwork as one of the major factors in the rebirth of the genre in the 60s. He even weighs in on the deCamp and Carter Conan pastiche controversy in probably the most even-keeled and sober exploration of the subject I&rsquo;ve read to date.</p>\n<p>There is a great deal to discover in&nbsp;<strong>Flame and Crimson</strong>, everything from fanzine discussions and literary feuds, to marketing shenanigans and forgotten classics.

It moves with purpose through the streets, possessing thugs and killers in an apparent mission to crash a royal wedding, rendering all those who partake of its &ldquo;heady white wine of murder&rdquo; into marionettes of death. Fafhrd, recently flushed with a self-justifying protective idealism, and Mouser, too narcissistically absorbed by his own personal hatreds and envies to heed external ones, prove immune.

Corum Jhaelen Irsei, the Prince with the Silver Hand, reborn in a world not his own, is the only hero who can stop these servants of Chaos and Old Night. Moorcock&rsquo;s powers of invention are firing on all cylinders in describing his Lords of Winter, and the mystery and dramatic tension surrounding these alien beings half-glimpsed in mist is some of the most powerful imagery in the entire Eternal Champion saga. Having slipped between the gaps in the walls of the multiverse, the hulking and bizarre Fhoi Myore seek to remake the world into their native Limbo, plunging the globe into a final deadly winter, all while their own bodies rot and decay in consequence to the entropic diseases they spawn. The half-hint that the Fhoi Myore, semi-idiot beings of implacable will who themselves are as doomed as the world that they are in the process of destroying, may actually be the final form of the magnificently puissant Chaos Gods of the first Chronicles of Corum makes them all the more monstrous and strange.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-worms.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-46619\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-worms.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-worms.jpg 399w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-worms-199x300.jpg 199w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>The Worms of the Earth</strong></h2>\n<p>Robert E.

He only felt that he was looking upon a cosmic tragedy, and he shrank with shame, as if the guilt of a whole race were laid upon him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Horrible in its alienness, it is rendered pitiable in its suffering, and it is a pathos as vast as the being&rsquo;s own eldritch and cosmic nature. Conan, far more attuned to the sacredness of natural law than the venal city priest Yara, demonstrates that barbarism isn&rsquo;t the same thing as savagery, freeing one monster, and exacting justice on another. A brilliant reminder that not all monstrous beings need a length of steel rammed through their bellies &ndash; just most of them.</p>', '2022-03-18T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_101221_1.jpg');
INSERT INTO `blog_post` (`id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`, `user_id`, `hidden`, `image_url`) VALUES (11, 'Ten Sword-and-Sorcery Tales For the Haunting Season\n', '<p>On a blog such as this, I doubt I&rsquo;m alone in my irrational love of Halloween, a holiday for me that, more than Thanksgiving or Christmas, evokes a Ray Bradbury-like level of nostalgia and anticipation. Here in New England, I find that as the leaves begin to turn and October shadows lengthen, so too do my thoughts drift from my natural sword-and-sorcery bent toward the nether regions of horror. Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King, classic Hammer movies and bad slasher films, bring it on, all of it.</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;m also reminded that I need not necessarily choose between the two. Sword-and-sorcery after all is bedfellows with horror. Though he loathed the term, Karl Edward Wagner described S&amp;S as &ldquo;a fascinating synthesis of horror, adventure, and imagination &hellip; the common motif is a universe in which magic works and an individual may kill according to his personal code.&rdquo; KEW&rsquo;s parameters are broad enough to accommodate the likes of his own Kane, or Freddy Krueger (cut the man some slack, he had his reasons).</p>\n<p>S&amp;S can deliver the same delicious chill that results when we encounter the unknown and the irrational, or the grotesque, in the pages of horror fiction. Like that most desired of Halloween treats, these two flavors in the right proportions blend to create delicious reading.</p>\n<p>Where did S&amp;S acquire its heritage of horror? One source is H.P. Lovecraft. While not a sword-and-sorcery author, Lovecraft&rsquo;s early Dream Cycle stories, which he referred to as his Dunsany phase, at times offered an effective blend of heroic fantasy and horror. In one such story, &ldquo;The Doom that Came to Sarnath&rdquo; (1920), the young warriors of Sarnath sack the ancient city of Ib and slaughter its loathsome residents. The warriors of Sarnath are no cringing, incredulous investigators, but men who slay without mercy and take back with them a green idol as a trophy for their city, ensuring their eventual doom. L. Sprague de Camp saw enough S&amp;S in this tale to add to his seminal anthology&nbsp;<strong>Swords &amp; Sorcery</strong>&nbsp;(1963), and it&rsquo;s certainly not out of place there.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, here are my Top 10 horror-infused sword-and-sorcery stories:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-Death-Angels-Shadow.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-46513\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-Death-Angels-Shadow-595x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"390\"></a>1. &ldquo;Reflections for the Winter of My Soul,&rdquo; Karl Edward Wagner.</strong></p>\n<p>A werewolf murder mystery played out amongst a group of suspicious guests, stranded in a castle in a driving snowstorm, and featuring the immortal and amoral Kane. Need I say more? KEW was a master of horror (see &ldquo;Sticks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where the Summer Ends&rdquo;) and he blends that element successfully here to create a memorable S&amp;S tale.</p>\n<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Barrow Troll,&rdquo; David Drake.</strong></p>\n<p>Originally published in 1975 in&nbsp;<strong>Whispers</strong>&nbsp;magazine, a former periodical specializing in dark fantasy and horror, editor Stuart David Schiff described Drake&rsquo;s story as &ldquo;a brutal and shocking piece,&rdquo; and that was precisely the effect it had and still has on me. A warning about the corruptive, corrosive dangers of hoarding wealth.</p>\n<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Thieves House,&rdquo; Fritz Leiber.</strong></p>\n<p>So much in here for the horror aficionado&mdash;the skull of Ohmphal with its great ruby eyes and pair of jeweled hands, blind wanderings through dry crypts, bats, mummies, murder, and a centuries-old vengeance fulfilled. Though I was tempted to go with &ldquo;Ill Met in Lankhmar&rdquo; due to its grisly twist, the discovery of two &ldquo;longish heaps&rdquo; of bloody flesh and bone, the remains of our hero&rsquo;s love interests.</p>\n<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The Beast of Averoigne,&rdquo; Clark Ashton Smith.</strong></p>\n<p>Like Lovecraft, Smith is best classified as a horror author, but he also wrote some dark S&amp;S including this tale from the May 1933&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>. It contains most of the subgenre&rsquo;s classic trappings, including a medieval setting, horror, and monsters pitted against sorcery and steel. A portentous red comet passes near Averoigne&mdash;Smith&rsquo;s fantastic stand-in for medieval France&mdash;and deposits an amorphous, shadowy beast that wreaks havoc by night. The monster kills and partially consumes beasts, then eventually men, women, and children. A local abbot enlists a sorcerer and two men-at-arms to summon a demon and put an end to the creature.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-jirel.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-46514\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-jirel.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-jirel.jpg 611w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-jirel-179x300.jpg 179w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-jirel-600x1006.jpg 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"377\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>5. &ldquo;Hellsgarde,&rdquo; C.L. Moore.</strong></p>\n<p>I describe this tale as horror masquerading as S&amp;S. It&rsquo;s a terrifying tale of a revenant-haunted, hell-guarded castle that can only be come upon at night. Moore&rsquo;s red-haired heroine Jirel, alone, must overcome her fears and enter. This passage says it all: &ldquo;But&mdash;the mists between her and the castle had thickened, and her eyes might be playing her false&mdash;but were not those the shapes of men drawn up in a double row before the doorway of Hellsgarde? Hellsgarde, that had stood empty and haunted these two hundred years? Blinking through the dazzle of sun on water and the thickening of the mists, she rode on toward the gateway. She could feel the horse trembling between her knees, and with every step he grew more and more reluctant to go on. She set her teeth and forced him ahead resolutely, swallowing her own terror.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Worms of the Earth,&rdquo; Robert E. Howard.</strong></p>\n<p>Howard was a very effective horror writer (see &ldquo;Pigeons from Hell&rdquo;) but also chilled with his sword-and-sorcery, perhaps nowhere better than this classic tale of Bran Mak Morn, who summons subhuman horrors to fulfill a near unhinged mission of vengeance against his Roman oppressors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Liane the Wayfarer,&rdquo; Jack Vance.</strong></p>\n<p>Who hasn&rsquo;t dreamt about running from some pursuing horror, but your legs seem to be caught in quicksand as the beast draws inexorably closer? Chun the Unavoidable is the stuff of nightmares, as are the eyeless victims of his murderous ways.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-46515\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover-634x1024.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover-634x1024.jpg 634w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover-186x300.jpg 186w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover-768x1241.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover-951x1536.jpg 951w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover-600x969.jpg 600w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAD_cover.jpg 1238w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"363\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>8. &ldquo;The Sustenance of Hoak,&rdquo; Ramsey Campbell.</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell is a modern master of weird horror, and when he applied his talents to S&amp;S, writing for the likes of the&nbsp;<strong>Swords Against Darkness</strong>&nbsp;anthologies in the 1970s, it proved chillingly effective. &ldquo;The Sustenance of Hoak&rdquo; is unsettling, somewhat appalling, and therefore well-done. I am very glad to hear that his stories of Ryre, rare and hard to obtain, will be reprinted by the fine folks over at DMR.</p>\n<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The Tale of Hauk,&rdquo; Poul Anderson.</strong></p>\n<p>This oft-reprinted tale of a Viking chieftain, bitter at his &ldquo;straw death&rdquo; and back from the dead as a vengeful revenant, never fails to evoke terror. &ldquo;Geirolf rocked into sight.

This story is something of a spiritual successor to &ldquo;The Doom that Came to Sarnath,&rdquo; with the main character, the warrior Sounnu, seeking to make amends for the wanton destruction of a strange race of mushroom men. Sounnu is an outcast, exiled for destroying an alien idol that through the centuries had become venerated among his people.

Howard in his stories of Conan the Cimmerian. In the July issue of that same year, however, Fritz Leiber offered another term in reply, writing, &ldquo;I feel more certain than ever that this field should be called the sword-and-sorcery story.&rdquo; Leiber elaborates a bit on his coinage, adding that this term &ldquo;accurately describes the points of culture-level and supernatural element,&rdquo; as well as being useful in distinguishing these stories from other popular pulp genres.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Leiber began corresponding with Lovecraft in November 1936 and immediately impressed the older writer. Lovecraft described Leiber, in a letter to R.H. Barlow, as &ldquo;a genuine find&rdquo; and took a great interest in both Leiber&rsquo;s poetry and fiction. Lovecraft read &ldquo;Adept&rsquo;s Gambit&rdquo; and wrote a long letter to Leiber in which he praised the tale and commented on it extensively. Among Lovecraft&rsquo;s criticisms were numerous historical errors and anachronisms. No doubt long-time fans of the stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser must be wondering what sort of errors and anachronisms HPL could possibly have found in a story set in Lankhmar, a wholly fantastical city. The fascinating truth is that the story was&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>set in Lankhmar at all but in the city of Tyre during the time of the Seleucid dynasty.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AdeptsGambit.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3912\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AdeptsGambit-219x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AdeptsGambit-219x300.png 219w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AdeptsGambit-77x105.png 77w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AdeptsGambit.png 236w\" alt=\"AdeptsGambit\" width=\"225\" height=\"308\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>Lovecraft urged Leiber to rework his story so that it was not a historical fantasy but rather a straight fantasy without any real-world references. In addition, he suggested that Leiber excise allusions to elements of his own Cthulhu Mythos. While it might be a stretch to say that H.P. Lovecraft was inadvertently responsible for the creation of Nehwon, the fact remains that, prior to receiving his critiques of &ldquo;Adept&rsquo;s Gambit,&rdquo; Leiber was seemingly more interested in using the world of Late Antiquity than in creating his own original setting. On the other hand, there is evidence that Lankhmar (sometimes spelled Lankmar or Lahkmar) already &ldquo;existed&rdquo; in some fashion as early as 1934, though why Leiber chose not to use that name and location in &ldquo;Adept&rsquo;s Gambit&rdquo; is anyone&rsquo;s guess. In any event, after his correspondence with Lovecraft, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser became firmly ensconced in Nehwon, appearing in more than three dozen short stories, novellas, and novels between 1958 and 1988.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Of interest to roleplayers is the fact that Leiber and Fischer were ahead of their time when it came to considering the possibility of using Nehwon as the basis for a game. Sometime in 1937, after Leiber had begun his correspondence with Lovecraft, the two of them created a wargame set in the city they had imagined together. The game board depicted the city of Lankhmar and the surrounding areas of Nehwon and was quite large&mdash;about five feet long and two and a half feet wide&mdash;and constructed of multiple layers of cardboard, enabling differentiation between high and low elevation. Individual heroes were represented with corks, while mercenaries, mounts, and weapons were represented through the use of other tokens.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LankhmarTSR.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3911\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LankhmarTSR-300x240.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LankhmarTSR-300x240.png 300w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LankhmarTSR-768x616.png 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LankhmarTSR-1024x821.png 1024w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LankhmarTSR-77x62.png 77w\" alt=\"LankhmarTSR\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>The goal of the game was to amass wealth and power in Nehwon, but what makes it especially noteworthy in hindsight is its individual focus. Players assume the roles of heroes in their adventures and quests rather than abstract military commanders, as was common in wargames of the time. While not explicitly a roleplaying game in the sense we understand that term today, Leiber and Fischer&rsquo;s game does look, with the benefit of hindsight, to have been yet another example of a wargame used as the basis of a proto-RPG, years before David Wesely&rsquo;s first Braunstein scenario or Dave Arneson&rsquo;s first Blackmoor session. Gary Gygax may well have recognized this, too, leading to the formal publication of the game by TSR in 1976 under the name&nbsp;<strong>Lankhmar</strong></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Remarkable though&nbsp;<strong>Lankhmar</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>is from a historical perspective, its influence on RPGs is non-existent, postdating, as it does, the initial publication of&nbsp;<strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>. Fritz Leiber&rsquo;s more direct influence comes in the form of the many adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser that he penned over the course of three decades. Like Abraham Merritt mentioned in a previous installment of this series of essays, Gary Gygax consistently singled out Leiber as being an author whose works he especially enjoyed. There can be little wonder why this might have been the case. Unlike Howard&rsquo;s Conan, who was by nature a loner, Leiber&rsquo;s duo were (with one notable exception) inseparable, fighting side by side against all manner of foes in pursuit of gold and glory. They could, in fact, quite reasonably be called archetypal player characters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Land-of-Nehwon.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3914\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Land-of-Nehwon-227x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Land-of-Nehwon-227x300.png 227w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Land-of-Nehwon-77x102.png 77w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Land-of-Nehwon.png 641w\" alt=\"Land of Nehwon\" width=\"225\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>Above all, however, Fritz Leiber&rsquo;s stories are rollicking good fun, filled with exotic locales, perilous dangers, and witty dialog &ndash; everything that a good fantasy adventure should contain. These stories are fast-paced and engaging, yet not without depth. Indeed, one of Leiber&rsquo;s most notable qualities as a writer is his ability to create believable characters whose virtues and flaws propel the story. The world of Nehwon is a fascinating one, to be sure, but, for my money, it is Leiber&rsquo;s characters, from Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser to Pulgh the Overlord to Krovas of the Thieves&rsquo; Guild and more. These characters help to ground the fantasy of his stories, which gives him leave to let his imagination run wild when it comes to his descriptions of strange lands, horrific beasts, and wondrous magic. Fans of fantasy, whether literature or games, would do well to spend some time with this master of the genre.</span></p>', '2023-02-20T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_091421_1.jpg');

Flame-haired, tenacious as a she-lion, &ldquo;a shouting battle-machine,&rdquo; sojourner in forbidden magical lands&mdash;Jirel was the first woman of the sword to do battle against sorcery.</p>\n<p>Jirel did not come on to the fantasy scene quietly. She slashed out of the table of contents of&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;with a formidable willpower that still places her in the top ranks of fantasy heroines. She only appeared in six novelettes between 1934 and 1939, but she and her creator C. L. Moore became permanent stars of speculative fiction&mdash;the two women who ripped down the &ldquo;Men Only&rdquo; sign from the fantasy door.</p>\n<p>The Lady of Joiry would never have had such a lasting impact if it weren&rsquo;t for Catherine Lucille Moore&rsquo;s immense writing talent, which was evident from her first published story. &ldquo;I was reared on a diet of Greek mythology, Oz books and Edgar Rice Burroughs, so you can see I never had a chance,&rdquo; she remembered of her childhood. At age twenty-two, while working at a bank in Indianapolis, she made her first writing sale with the oddly titled dark science-fiction piece &ldquo;Shambleau.&rdquo; Editor Farnsworth Wright at&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;recognized a brilliant new author and published the story in the November 1933 issue. &ldquo;Shambleau&rdquo; introduced Northwest Smith, Moore&rsquo;s influential galaxy-wandering rogue. The evocative atmosphere, emotional power, and gripping prose stood out among planetary SF of the time; it was a breathtaking performance that launched Moore to the front of the&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>&nbsp;bullpen.</p>\n<p>Jirel arrived less than a year later in &ldquo;Black God&rsquo;s Kiss,&rdquo; still one of the best stories to appear in&nbsp;<strong>Weird Tales</strong>. Five more adventures followed: &ldquo;Black God&rsquo;s Shadow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jirel Meets Magic,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dark Land,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hellsgarde,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quest of the Starstone.&rdquo; The last she co-wrote with her future husband, Henry Kuttner, and it brought together Jirel and Northwest Smith in their only meeting.</p>\n<p>Although a sword-and-sorcery heroine, Jirel isn&rsquo;t merely a gender-swapped Conan or Amazonian clich&eacute;. She&rsquo;s a woman of complex contradictions: iron heroism combined with emotional receptivity. Unrelenting in battle and filled with rage that often sparks in her yellow eyes (&ldquo;the yellow blaze of her eyes held fury as a crucible holds fire&rdquo;), Jirel is also driven by dark passions and pathos. She&rsquo;s modern in her defiance of masculine conventions of the Middle Ages&mdash;a woman landowner and respected war leader&mdash;but is also brazenly medieval, possessed of aristocratic haughtiness and an admirer of the art of torture. She allows no man to force himself on her (this is the engine behind the first story, &ldquo;Black God&rsquo;s Kiss&rdquo;), but admits an enjoyment of casual romance and sex&mdash;as much as could be admitted in the &lsquo;30s pulps: &ldquo;She remembered laughter and singing and gayety &hellip; she remembered kisses in the dark, and the hard grip of men&rsquo;s arms about her body.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-paizo_black_gods_kiss.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-41170\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-paizo_black_gods_kiss.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-paizo_black_gods_kiss.jpg 260w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-paizo_black_gods_kiss-195x300.jpg 195w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>&ldquo;Black God&rsquo;s Kiss,&rdquo; the most anthologized of the Jirel stories, still evokes complex reactions from readers. It set the template for most of the stories: Jirel, seeking a tool against a foe, enters into a eldritch realm. Lands of the weird were Moore&rsquo;s specialty, and this was where Jirel often found herself. Although armed with her favorite two-handed sword and dagger, the Lady of Joiry rarely uses them against the creatures of these otherworlds. Her willpower, her mental resources of pain and tempestuous love are her principal weapons against opponents such as the inhuman sorceress Jarisme (&ldquo;Jirel Meets Magic&rdquo;) and the inhabitants of the dark land of the warlock Pav of Romne (&ldquo;The Dark Land&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>In &ldquo;Black God&rsquo;s Kiss,&rdquo; Jirel searches a surreal realm to find magic to avenge herself against the man who has conquered Joiry and humiliated her by forcing a kiss on her. After passing through many dark marvels, and even shedding tears for the denizens in torment, Jirel makes a pact with the Black God for revenge&mdash;only to discover a hidden and painful truth about her desires.</p>\n<p>The best story after &ldquo;Black God&rsquo;s Kiss&rdquo; is &ldquo;Jirel Meets Magic,&rdquo; which pits the heroine against a fay sorceress. Jarisme is an ideal opposite to Jirel: cold and icy, as inhuman as Jirel is full of humanity.

INSERT INTO `blog_post` (`id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`, `user_id`, `hidden`, `image_url`) VALUES (14, 'Archetypes of Adventure: Conan and Elric\n', '<p><img style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rehdragon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\">Few characters in fantasy are as iconic as Conan the Cimmerian: black-haired barbarian warrior with the deadly grace of a panther and the impressive physique of a prize fighter, a wanderer, a reaver, and a king by his own hand. Michael Moorcock&rsquo;s Elric of Melnibone perhaps rivals Conan in terms of iconic status (if not exactly in market saturation), perhaps in part due to his deliberate inversion of many of Conan&rsquo;s characteristics. Elric is slender and frail where Conan is the brawny image of impervious good health, Elric is a sickly albino reliant on concoctions of medicinal herbs to function, while Conan voraciously drains wineskins and gnaws beef-bones. Elric becomes both master and servant to a magical black sword, whereas Conan fights with whatever suits his setting or whatever is at hand &mdash; including the aforementioned beef-bones! The physicality of both is key to their characters, and both represent an extreme of appearance and function that renders them iconic in the fullest sense of the term: it isn&rsquo;t just that they are famous creations, it&rsquo;s that they both carry a symbolic weight that is integral to not only their character, but to every story in which they appear or, to some extent, to every kind of story that draws on them for inspiration.</p>\n<p>The genesis of both characters stems from Robert E. Howard&rsquo;s and Michael Moorcock&rsquo;s writing of magazine fiction, with its emphasis on pacing and accessibility. The more easily and immediately comprehensible an element of such stories, the better it works in a short form that may appear out of sequence or across separate venues &ndash; for in the case of magazine short fiction, every single story will be someone&rsquo;s introduction to reoccurring character or world. Hence, iconic or archetypal characters &ndash; the sort that are not only easy to convey with a few words but, just as importantly, create a strong image for illustration* &ndash; are a real key to building a following for these kinds of serial heroes. The criticism frequently leveled upon this kind of fiction is that it lacks &lsquo;well-done&rsquo; characters, which always seems to strangely miss the necessary point that magazine short adventure fiction must distill story elements down to the level of the instinctive and symbolic in order to get on with entertaining through plot. One might as well ding Jane Austen for how she handles battle scenes, or lament the lack of supernatural horror in Proust, than to talk about flat characters in sword-and-sorcery.</p>\n<p>The other element of this magazine approach that influenced the shape of both of these characters is that both are told out of any kind of chronological order, and grow organically over subsequent tales. Already the earliest Conan and Elric stories establish certain very strong traits and characteristics and biographical facts that serve as a foundation to develop further details &ndash; and both are much more fully realized than, for example, another beloved, very iconic magazine character, Sherlock Holmes, whose initial incarnation undergoes some fairly extensive ret-coning as he goes from unrepentantly uncultured calculating machine to someone who plays the violin and must occupy his higher faculties with regular visits to the opera! This non-linear &lsquo;career hopping&rsquo; of Howard&rsquo;s and Moorcock&rsquo;s allows not only great opportunities for foreshadowing (it&rsquo;s really easy to foreshadow something you&rsquo;ve already written years ago) such as found in the &lsquo;first&rsquo; Elric novel (<strong>Elric of Melnibone</strong>) or the many mentions by Conan that perhaps he&rsquo;d like to try his hand at kingship, but it also actually creates some further opportunities for characterization by highlighting watershed moments in the development of each character.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zw.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-63244\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zw.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zw.jpg 801w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zw-300x185.jpg 300w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zw-768x474.jpg 768w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zw-600x370.jpg 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"></a>\n<figcaption>Conan and Elric meet, in the world of Comic Book Crossovers</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p>Of the two, Conan is the more developed in his magazine incarnations &ndash; though Moorcock has the advantage of coming back to his character years later in longer works. But Conan demonstrates real growth as a character, and does so in a completely non-linear fashion, simply by virtue of the small developments in the character over the course of key individual stories. His moral development in &ldquo;The Tower of the Elephant,&rdquo; or his assumption of a leadership role in &ldquo;Black Colossus,&rdquo; reveal two integral aspects of his character that are there in both earlier and later stories. For Elric, a more static character, subsequent tales or stories about his past are less opportunities to demonstrate character development than to enlarge upon his eventual fate &mdash; to fill in not only his tragic &lsquo;origin story,&rsquo; but to re-engineer it in light of the dramatic culmination of his saga. Like Holmes, Elric too was killed by his creator far too early in his career, however, unlike Doyle, Moorcock&rsquo;s apotheosis for Elric informs much of what he would go on to write about the character over many more stories and books.</p>\n<p>And, while Elric is deliberately an &lsquo;anti-Conan&rsquo; in many ways, mostly in his physical inversion of the Cimmerian, but also in the angsty nihilism of a character who doubts his own free will, both characters are more similar than they may at first appear. Both are complete outsiders &ndash; even the Elric who sits upon the Ruby Throne he was born to occupy is a strange alien to his own people &ndash; and both are naive when appropriate . . . either for the character, or the plot. Conan&rsquo;s naivete is that of the fish-out-of-water barbarian wandering in civilized lands, whereas Elric&rsquo;s is primarily the foolishly misplaced trust he shows in his cousin and rival. The cynical, demon-conversing, sorcery-using Elric is very different from the magic-hating, practically-minded Conan, but both experience the occasional &lsquo;knowledge gap&rsquo; when the story demands it. In fact, that&rsquo;s one of the necessary ingredients of such stories, because we as the audience are also strangers, and need to have information parceled out to us in a way that makes it palatable and comprehensible.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/tftms/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/09/acestormbringer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\">We are told that Conan broods, has &ldquo;gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirths&rdquo; but seldom do we really see it. This isn&rsquo;t a flaw in characterization, this is the difference between biography and fiction &ndash; the Conan we experience is a man of action set free of his larger burdens through motion, through&nbsp;<em>doing things</em>. Perhaps if we were to visit him in his cups, all ablutions poured out, a little longer after the events of &ldquo;Beyond the Black River,&rdquo; or if the winged apes had left him alone after slaying his lover in &ldquo;Queen of the Black Coast,&rdquo; we would have gotten more of a taste of this aspect of his character.</p>\n<p>Elric, of course, has a problem with losing himself in action &ndash; because it also means losing his will, his very soul, to the black vampiric sword that fills him with a wild rush of stolen power. When he shows elation at this quickening of his impulses, he is always depicted as regressing somewhat to the cruel and inhuman ways of his people, and as always with Elric the specter of regret and self-loathing resurfaces afterward. No winged ape slew his lover, that was done by Elric&rsquo;s own blade, twisting in his hand to gloat over one more soul lost, one more move made on the chessboard of fate that contains Elric&rsquo;s own doom. This may be one of the biggest differences between the two characters, surface characteristics aside. Conan&rsquo;s hyper-competence in the physical space of violent action offers him a real freedom &ndash; perhaps even a &lsquo;gigantic mirth&rsquo; &ndash; and his instinctive, &lsquo;in the zone&rsquo; adventuring is a more potent elixir than any Melnibonean concoction. Elric&rsquo;s own superhuman abilities only serve to further reinforce that he is not his own master, and to damn him further as those close to him pay the price for his power.</p>\n<p>Both free Conan and unfree Elric of course have an ultimate master &ndash; their respective authors, or perhaps the dictates of adventure fiction itself. Each author has a radically different approach to arriving at a kind of common ground &ndash; Conan&rsquo;s actions, even when he isn&rsquo;t the main character, grow out of his motivations as a character, and Howard is so skillful at this that even his most coincidence-laden, plot-heavy, or formulaic Conan stories never feel as if they are on rails, they have an authenticity born out of the character himself. Moorcock does almost the opposite, somehow legitimating fantasy tropes by deliberately drawing attention to them and to the plot itself, paradoxically enlarging the importance of his character by simultaneously rendering him but one of a billion incarnations across a vast microcosm of space and time.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Let me live deep while I live; let me know the rich juices of red meat and stinging wine on my palate, the hot embrace of white arms, the mad exultation of battle when the blue blades flame and crimson, and I am content. Let teachers and philosophers brood over questions of reality and illusion. I know this: if life is illusion, then I am no less an illusion, and being thus, the illusion is real to me. I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and am content.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Queen of the Black Coast&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>Elric was not interested in such philosophizing. &ldquo;Dream or reality, the experience amounts to the same, does it not?&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>The Sailor on the Seas of Fate</strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conanelriccrossover.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-63245\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" src=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conanelriccrossover.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" srcset=\"https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conanelriccrossover.jpg 220w, https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/conanelriccrossover-202x300.jpg 202w\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"></a>Here is the true common ground between Conan and Elric, enough to render them the closest of kin. Whether deriving freedom or damnation through action, for both characters the action itself has definite meaning &ndash; just as storytelling itself has an intrinsic, non-diminishable, value. For all his nihilism and self-doubt, Elric does not consider his dreamlike life an illusion &ndash; in fact, he&rsquo;s almost impatient with the notion, when hearing it discussed by other aspects of the Eternal Champion. Such a concept, of course, would invalidate the suffering that is at the heart of the character, and for that alone Elric would have to dismiss it. But further than that, for Conan and Elric both, it&rsquo;s we the reader who might entertain such solipsistic conceits in some post-modern litfic or sci-fi story, but when it comes to the serious business of sword-and-sorcery, it just won&rsquo;t fly. Because to believe in them as we do,&nbsp;<em>they</em> have to believe in what they do: something Conan and Elric, and Howard and Moorcock, demonstrate time and again over an impressive collection of classic tales.</p>', '2023-10-22T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://goodman-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WebsiteGraphic_WIDE_011723_1.jpg');

Howard, the creator of Conan the Barbarian, remains one of the most important literary figures in American fantasy. His influence has been as strong, as profound, as any contribution made by J.R.R. Tolkien or Lewis Carroll. Unlike those genteel British authors however, his work was a product of a very different environment &ndash; the corrupt, violent world of the Texan Oil-Boom.</p>\n<p>The pulp magazines were born out of the Victorian penny dreadfuls and dime-novels, printed in huge volumes on the cheapest possible paper, and packed with lurid, exciting stories of all imaginable sorts. As printing technology got better the pulps lost ground, and modern comics took their place. At their height however, in the thirties, some of the pulps were selling a million copies an issue. The pulps were the perfect home for Howard&rsquo;s bloody, action-packed tales, and he became hugely popular. Had he lived longer, he would have seen his work move outside them, but he took his own life as his first novel was nearing publication.</p>\n<p>In just thirty years, he managed to write more than four hundred stories and five hundred poems. Many of them were published in his lifetime, enough to provide him with a very solid living. In addition to the genres he created himself, Sword and Sorcery and Weird West, Howard wrote substantially in the genres of boxing, westerns, horror, mythic/romantic history, adventure, comedy, mystery, and even some mild erotica. His legacy has been the most profound within fantasy however, and that is where he is best-remembered.</p>\n<p>Robert Ervin Howard was born on January 22, 1906 in the tiny Texas community of Peaster to Isaac and Hester Howard. Isaac was a country doctor, and the family moved regularly from town to town providing medical services to places in need of a healer. The oil-boom had begun in earnest in 1901, and the Howards travelled around in its wake, going to a succession of boom towns, cattle towns, and other places where growth was suddenly exceeding the established capacities.</p>\n<p>This world had a profound effect on the young child. As the son of a doctor, he had constant exposure to physical trauma. Horrible accidents and injuries were disturbingly common in the new, voraciously unregulated industry, but so were violence and murder. Besides, while the American Frontier period was already passing into myth, there were lots of older folks around who&rsquo;d lived through it, and the towns were steeped in bloody stories of gunfights, native raids, crime sprees and murders. There were also plenty of former slaves with their own stories to tell of lynchings and abuses, and with myths and legends passed down from their hereditary cultures.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-251 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"The life and death of Robert E. Howard 1\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0136.jpg\" alt=\"Conan The life and death of Robert E. Howard\" width=\"216\" height=\"280\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0136.jpg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\"></p>\n<p>Howard grew up steeped in a thick, ugly brew of violence, hatred and corruption from the very beginning. The boom towns he lived in were dangerous places, filled with swaggering bullies and drunks, and precious few policemen around to rein them in. Naturally, there were lots of savage predators swarming around these roughnecks, ready to part them from their impressive earnings. There was very little justice to be seen. Being in this environment at a young age had a deep effect.</p>\n<p>There was another side to the violence, though. Boxing was far and away the most popular sport in the nation during this period, and Howard was fascinated with it. He was particularly drawn to the &lsquo;iron men&rsquo; &ndash; boxers of no particular skill or grace whose incredible resilience made them very effective competitors. This astonishing stamina would go on to become a key characteristic of his heroes, and he came to consider violent contest as one of the most important pursuits available to a man.</p>\n<p>Hester Howard was an educated woman with a deep love of books and poetry, and she did her best to temper her son&rsquo;s world. She read books and poems with him every day, taught him to be curious about history, and did everything she could to encourage him in his writing. She was generous with her family to a fault. During her youth, she&rsquo;d spent extended periods of time caring for various sickly family members. Sadly, as a consequence she caught tuberculosis, and she was already unwell when Howard was born. From her, he developed a deep love of poetry, writing, and history, but he also internalised the unintended lesson that virtue brought only punishment, because the world was cruel, random, and pointless.</p>\n<p>These influences combined over the course of Howard&rsquo;s childhood to leave him with a deep, bedrock-layer distrust of civilisation. Progress meant debauchery and crime, and the more society progressed, the nastier it became until it would, inevitably, collapse under the weight of its own unpleasantness. Purity lay in simpler times, with the rule of virtuous masculinity as embodied by strength and a simplicity that was the enemy of devious, morally-compromised sophistication.</p>\n<p>Howard&rsquo;s first formal schooling was in 1914, in the town of Bagwell. He was eight. It took very little time for him to find the atmosphere confining. His memory was superb, possibly even fully eidetic, and so he spent most of his time extremely bored. Fitting in to the school world at the time meant roughhousing and play-fighting, but his mother did not approve, and stopped him at every turn. Resentful classmates quickly turned into enthusiastic bullies, which helped to reinforce the nihilistic feelings that he was already developing, and heighten his distaste for the modern world. He was writing bloody battle stories of Vikings and Arab warriors by the age of nine, and reading extensively &ndash; myth, legend, history, adventure tales of the east, stories of reincarnation and past life memories, anything with some wonder and excitement.</p>\n<p>The family continued to move around, finally settling in the small, quiet town of Cross Plains in 1919. Isaac bought a house, and had it fitted with all the modern conveniences like electricity, plumbing, and gas. Later that year, he went to New Orleans to take some medical courses, and the family went with him. During that visit, Howard found a rather fanciful book on British history at a Canal Street library, and first encountered the Picts &ndash; the warlike inhabitants of northern and eastern Scotland who daubed themselves in woad and gave the Romans such a hard time. There were portrayed as ignorant, savage barbarians, outsiders who viewed society with great scepticism. While they lived lives of gruelling hardship though, they possessed true freedom and a vibrant sense of defiance. They captured the boy&rsquo;s imagination, becoming a symbol of what the world had once been, and had now lost.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-252 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"The life and death of Robert E.

Howard Museum</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>The following year, to fourteen-year-old Howard&rsquo;s horror, an oil gusher was discovered within Cross Plains, and it instantly became a boom-town. Money poured in, along with a horde of rough, hard-bitten workers. Vice and organised crime came with them, flooding everything. Suddenly the streets were filled with swaggering bullies and supercilious oil barons, corrupt lawyers and councillors, gangsters and prostitutes, drugs, gambling, and even outright banditry. The population grew almost tenfold in nearly no time at all, and Howard saw his peers dissolving into this toxic new environment. If there had ever been a chance of him softening his opinion of society, it died there.</p>\n<p>He turned away from the world, and dove enthusiastically into the pulps. Now fifteen, he started writing prolifically, submitting his work to any pulp he thought it might fit with. He created a slew of western and romantic historical characters that would go on to eventually find publication &ndash; Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, El Borak, The Sonora Kid &ndash; but only got a growing stack of rejection slips. Undeterred, he started studying the pulps rather than just reading them, observing the style and tone of the various publications, and working to match pieces to specific outlets.</p>\n<p>Publication finally came the following year, albeit unpaid. He was with his mother in lodgings in Brownwood, a nearby city, in order to attend his final year of high school. He made his first true friends here, other boys who loved not only sports, but also writing, history, and poetry. The school paper was called The Tattler, and in December 1922, it published two of his stories that had won prizes in small competitions.</p>\n<p>In 1923, aged 17, he went home to Cross Plains. He regularly exchanged long letters with his Brownwood friends, and created for himself a daily exercise routine to start building up muscle. This included chopping up logs, punching a filled grain sack, lifting weights, and doing jumps. He kept at it, and slowly became quite muscular. At the same time, he was working odd jobs that he universally loathed. These included collecting garbage, picking cotton in the fields, serving sodas, helping out in a grocery store, and a number of other menial, tiring, poorly-paid things.</p>\n<p>He returned to Brownwood in 1924 to do a course in stenography at Howard Payne Business College. He was lodging with a friend this time, and although the stipend his parents permitted him left him perpetually broke, he had a decent time. Over the Thanksgiving week that year, he finally received his first professional acceptance &ndash; Weird Tales agreed to publish the story &ldquo;Spear and Fang&rdquo;, which was about a Cro-Magnon man fighting against a Neanderthal, with a beautiful woman as the prize. He finished his stenography training, and rather than continue with business school, returned home to devote himself to becoming a full-time writer.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\">\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Asecond story acceptance from Weird Tales came just a few weeks later. Howard found work with the local newspaper, the Cross Plains Review, writing columns about the local oil industry. Over the next year or so, he lost the job at the newspaper, then gained and lost jobs at the post office, the gas company, an oil company, and other places besides. He was not temperamentally suited to being told what to do, and although he had no fear of hard work, he loathed being taken advantage of.</p>\n<p>Story sales continued, sporadic but frequent enough to keep him dedicated, and he became a regular contributor to Weird Tales. When he was 20, he got his first cover story with &ldquo;Wolfshead&rdquo;, a werewolf piece that Weird Tales were particularly happy with. He was working pulling sodas at the time, and although the pay was fair for once, the hours were absolutely gruelling. An oil-worker buddy suggested he try some amateur boxing as a way of unwinding. He loved it. Boxing immediately joined his writing as another important source of catharsis for his anger and frustration.</p>\n<p>That summer, exhausted and not writing, he made a deal with his father. Isaac would pay for his son to continue with the book-keeping program at Howard Payne Business College, and afterwards, would support him for a year whilst he tried to make writing a successful job. If he failed, he&rsquo;d take a book-keeping job in town. Howard went back to Brownwood and his friends. He caught measles late that year, 1926, and had to spend two months in convalescence, but in the summer of 1927, he completed the course.</p>\n<p>During the course, he devised and worked on &ldquo;The Shadow Kingdom&rdquo;, the first story of Kull the Conqueror. It was the first time that anyone had successfully combined fantasy, horror, mythology, high action, battle, swordplay and historical romance. In the process, he created the genre that would go on to be called Sword and Sorcery. He successfully submitted the story to Weird Tales in 1927.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually the first Sword and Sorcery story in print, though. In 1928, Weird Tales bought &ldquo;Red Shadows&rdquo;, the first Solomon Kane story they released. That was written in the same style, and they printed it late the same year, making it the first piece of Sword and Sorcery to actually be published.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Shadow Kingdom&rdquo; was released early in 1929, and proved incredibly popular. Over the course of the year, Howard also published boxing stories with three other magazines &ndash; &ldquo;The Apparition in the Prize Ring&rdquo; with Ghost Stories, &ldquo;The Pit of the Serpent&rdquo;, the first of the Sailor Steve Costigan boxing tales, with Fight Stories, and &ldquo;Crowd-horror&rdquo; with Argosy, one of the most prestigious of the pulps. Both Fight Stories and Weird Tales were now regular outlets for his work, and he was finally able to go full-time. His deal with his father had paid off.</p>\n<p>By 1930, Howard&rsquo;s long-term fascination with history had begun to blossom into a passion for Celtic history and myth. Now aged 24, he started investigating his ancestry, and even learned a little Gaelic. He started writing stories about Turlogh Dubh O&rsquo;Brien &ndash; which sold &ndash; and about Cormac Mac Art, which did not. A new pulp, Oriental Stories, attracted his immediate interest, and gave him a venue to explore middle age and renaissance settings for several series of tales that blended swordplay and battle with blended mysticism.</p>\n<p>That same year, Weird Tales published H. P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Rats in the Walls&rdquo;. Howard loved it, and wrote to the magazine praising it, particularly the sense of historicity imbued in its British setting. They passed the letter on to Lovecraft himself, who wrote a warm and grateful reply. The two quickly became pen-friends, and Lovecraft introduced Howards to his wider group of authorial acquaintances. The Lovecraft Circle were pulp authors and promising newcomers who attempted to look out for each other, help each other&rsquo;s careers, and dabble in each other&rsquo;s worlds. Through the Circle, Howard became interested in the Cthulhu mythos, and made several contributions. This was also where he was given his nickname of &lsquo;Two-Gun Bob&rsquo;, in deference to the rowdy Texan world he&rsquo;d grown up in.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1931, the Great Depression started to bite. Many pulps went bankrupt, and most of the ones that clung on were forced to change their procedures. Weird Tales survived where many of Howard&rsquo;s other publishers did not, but they were forced to go bimonthly, and they started paying quite slowly. To make things worse, his bank collapsed, wiping out his savings, and the little he did retain was then obliterated when his next bank collapsed as well.</p>\n<p>He went travelling around Texas early in 1932, and he was in a sullen, rainy border town on the Rio Grande when he first came up with the idea of a bleak, pitiless northern land named Cimmeria. The obvious inhabitant of such a place would be an equally bleak, pitiless barbarian &ndash; and his name was Conan.</p>\n<p>Howard was a master of the pulp market by this time, and he set out to make Conan as commercially appealing as possible. He got home and settled on the idea of an over-arching Hyborean Age, a time of pseudo-history uniting themes &ndash; and places &ndash; from across his earlier work. The first Conan story was a reworking of a Kull piece that hadn&rsquo;t sold. Howard ripped out the elements that had bogged it down, and revised what remained into a thrilling, vivid crowd-pleaser.</p>\n<p>By the time Weird Tales printed &ldquo;The Phoenix on the Sword&rdquo;, in December of 1932, Howard had already written nine more Conan tales, along with &ldquo;The Horror from the Mound&rdquo;, the first Weird West story, which was published in Weird Tales the following year.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\">\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Conan was taking Weird Tales by storm, so after a bit of a break, Howard dashed off another set of simple Conan yarns in early 1933. He took on Otis Kline as an agent to help him expand into other markets, with the understanding that Weird Tales would remain his own personal relationship. Kline helped him sell a number of stories that had previously been rejected, and encouraged him to broaden his horizon. Over the course of the year, Howard wrote his first story about James Allison, a disabled Texan who recalled adventurous past lives, and he finally made good use of his El Borak Texan gunslinger character, transporting him to Afghanistan, where he grimly tried to keep the peace in the era of the First World War. Late in the year, he returned to Conan, and started to work earnestly on deeper, punchier stories than the ones he&rsquo;d churned out some months before.</p>\n<p>In 1934, now 28, he started work on &ldquo;The Hour of the Dragon&rdquo;, a Conan novel requested by a British publishing house who felt that there was no real market in the UK for short stories. Unfortunately, the company collapsed before they were able to get the book published, and Weird Tales took it to release in sections. Howard was becoming interested in westerns at this point though, particularly humorous yarns and tall tales.</p>\n<p>Since Weird Tales was well behind on their payments, he decided to pursue this new fascination. Action Stories took the first of the Breckenridge Elkins stories, and loved it so much they had a new instalment of the series in every issue until significantly after Howard&rsquo;s death. Other pulps started clamouring for similar work, and he created clones of Elkins for Argosy (Pike Bearfield) and Cowboy Stories (Buckner J. Grimes).</p>\n<p>That same year, he started dating Novalyne Price, a former girlfriend of an old college friend of his who took a job in Cross Plains. Breckenridge Elkins quickly became the most successful series that Howard had ever written, and in 1935, he started work on an Elkins novel, &ldquo;A Gent From Bear Creek&rdquo;. He spent that whole year on his yarns, and earning more than he&rsquo;d ever managed to before. Although his professional life was more successful than ever, his relationship with Price was on-again, off-again &ndash; she was ill because of overwork, and he was deeply distracted by his mother&rsquo;s increasingly poor condition.</p>\n<p>Finally, in 1936, his mother was hospitalised with no expectation of recovery. On the morning of June 11th, he and his father were by her bedside when a nurse explained that she would not be coming out of the coma she had slipped into. Howard had set his affairs in order months before. He excused himself, went out to his car, and shot himself fatally in the head. His mother died a day later.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0138-1024x768.jpg\"></p>\n<p>It would be a mistake to put Howard&rsquo;s suicide down to filial grief or &ndash; as some opportunistic predators have claimed, an oedipal complex. He had considered suicide repeatedly over the years. He saw society as brutal, and life as cruel, but understood that the freedom and supposed purity he yearned for were impossible in the age he lived in. He also had a genuine horror of getting old, and was no stranger to dark moods. So say, instead, that his mother&rsquo;s survival to the age of 66 was what kept him tethered to the Earth long enough to leave us the work he did &ndash; and, in the process, to change fiction itself.</p>', '2023-10-23T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/life-and-times-of-robert-e-howard-compressed-2048x1280.jpg');

The Victorian straitjacket of housework and servitude was, if not slipping, then at least wearing thin. Writers, predominantly male, were still perfectly happy to continue reinforcing the old status quo however &ndash; that is, if it even occurred to them that there might be something to challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Women writers were even less likely that their male counterparts to have their characters step clearly out of line, since they already faced a battle merely to have their work considered. C. L. Moore&rsquo;s Jirel of Joiry is the clear exception &ndash; she was the first writer openly influenced by Howard&rsquo;s work, and Jirel the first female sword and sorcery protagonist. When he sent her a copy of his first Dark Agnes story, she was very enthusiastic.</p>\n<p>Women were not, typically, the focus of Robert E. Howard&rsquo;s tales. His earlier dramatic heroes, like Kull, Kane, and Mak Morn, were disinterested in sex &ndash; or, rather, too consumed with other, weightier matters to permit themselves any hint of self-indulgence. The comedic heroes, like Elkins, Costigan, and Dorgan, were lovelorn, desperately trying to win women&rsquo;s interest but rarely getting anywhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conan&rsquo;s stories are, of course, a deliberate departure from these other patterns. As discussed earlier, Conan was invented precisely to appeal to the modern, &rdquo;civilized&rdquo; nature that Howard despised. So the majority of the woman in the Cimmerian&rsquo;s path are weak and pliant, just there as busty trophies for the taking and then discarding. There are a couple of notable exceptions, and we&rsquo;ll get to them shortly. The rest, however, are best glossed over as fan service, a commercial decision that reflected only Howard&rsquo;s disdain for civilization and its conventions.</p>\n<p>But neither of these elements should be taken to indicate that Howard was in any way misogynistic. Quite the contrary. His strong, intelligent mother, and other important female influences in his early life, had instilled him with a deep respect for women that was highly unusual amongst the men of the time. Surviving letters show that he passionately defended women&rsquo;s achievements to his friends. As an adult, he fought often with his father about how his mother was treated, and when he fell in love, it was with Novalyne Price, a vibrant, free-spirited writer and history teacher. If anything, Howard&rsquo;s hesitation to write about women indicates an understanding of how the Pulp market demanded that they be treated, and a disinclination to lower himself to that level.</p>\n<p>So when he permitted himself to write the women he believed in, Howard was as exuberant and electric as ever. His publishers weren&rsquo;t particularly interested, so he didn&rsquo;t get to spend much time with these characters, and we are the poorer for it. But his women are every bit as interesting as his men, and worth just as much attention. One, in particular, remains famous today &ndash; sort of, anyway.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RED SONYA</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">No, that&rsquo;s not a typo. The pneumatic Red Sonja, of chainmail bikini and Brigitte Nielsen fame, was created in 1973 by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith to go into Marvel&rsquo;s Conan comics. Boris Vallejo&rsquo;s artistic genius helped ensure that her outfit became a cheesecake fantasy clich&eacute;. Red Sonja is very much a creation of her time, and if you want to know or see more, it&rsquo;s all just a Google away. She owes very little to Howard, save her name and initial seed of inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">&nbsp;</div>\n<img class=\"wp-image-516 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroines 1\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Magic_carpet_193401.jpg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroines\" width=\"223\" height=\"319\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Magic_carpet_193401.jpg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\">\n<p>Red Sonya of Rogatino, the one actually created by Robert E. Howard, is a very different person. She appears only in the story &ldquo;The Shadow of the Vulture&rdquo;, which was published in <em>The Magic Carpet Magazine</em>&nbsp;in the January 1934 edition. It&rsquo;s not a work of fantasy &ndash; the story is a retelling of the siege of Vienna in 1529. Suleiman the Magnificent, sultan of the Ottoman empire, had extended his borders to take control of much of Hungary at the Battle of Moh&aacute;cs in 1526. The siege of Vienna was his attempt to absorb the rest of Hungary, and push west to pave the way for further expansion into Western Europe. It&rsquo;s a great read, and it&rsquo;s fascinating to get a look at one of the nexus points of western history. If the weather had been a little better that year, I might easily be writing in Turkish now, rather than English.</p>\n<p>The main character of &ldquo;The Shadow of the Vulture&rdquo; is a fictional Austrian knight, an amiable drunkard named Gottfried Von Kalmbach who gets caught up in the siege. Red Sonya of Rogatino is one of the defenders, a ferocious and deadly Polish/Ukrainian swordswoman and pistoleer dressed in a steel cap, a shirt of chainmail, baggy trousers tucked into thigh-high leather boots, and a scarlet cloak. She&rsquo;s described variously as tall, lithe, splendid, and supple, with shoulder-length red-gold hair, and when she first appears, she&rsquo;s firing a cannon into a Turkish gun crew.</p>\n<p>Gottfried quickly finds out that she&rsquo;s the sister of the Sultan&rsquo;s favourite harem girl, and that she loathes the both of them with abiding passion. She doesn&rsquo;t go into detail, but between the lines, the implication is that she hates the Sultan for kidnapping and enslaving her sister, and her sister for becoming his enthusiastic companion. She&rsquo;s proud, and disdainful of Von Kalmbach, but treats the men around her genially. They, in return, treat her as they would any other skilled comrade &ndash; an unusual one for sure, but all the more respected for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite being unimpressed by Gottfried, Sonya saves his life several times anyway over the course of the story, demonstrating her skill, courage, and cunning. Along the way, she accidentally spites him into leading a drunken sally against the invaders &mdash;one which ends up triggering the end of Suleiman&rsquo;s siege. The story finishes with Gottfried and Sonya sending the sultan the severed head of his chief murderer, packed in herbs for freshness, along with an offensive little note. The implication is that they&rsquo;ve become at least friends.</p>\n<p>While Red Sonya&rsquo;s name was slightly tweaked for the comics character, there&rsquo;s little else of her in the Thomas and Smith creation. In fact, the &rsquo;73 barbarian owes considerably more of her inspiration to the most important of Howard&rsquo;s warrior women: Dark Agnes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DARK AGNES DE CHASTILLON</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Agnes de Chastillon was a French woman from a small village in Normandy called La Fere, the younger daughter of an aging former mercenary. Her father, a bastard son of the Duc de Chastillon, was a cruel and oppressive man who beat and verbally abused his children relentlessly. She hated him, but even so, she recognised that brutal years as a mercenary had warped him into the monster she knew. But there was no forgiveness in that understanding. Rather than fit into the unpleasant marriage and servitude he expected of her, she fled. The speed, resilience, strength and cunning she&rsquo;d learned from dealing with her father&rsquo;s abuses made her well-suited to combat, and she quickly became an expert swordswoman.&nbsp;</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-525 entered exited\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroines 2\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZpZXdCb3g9JzAgMCAyMzkgMzc5Jz48L3N2Zz4=\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroines\" width=\"239\" height=\"379\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sword-woman-cover-compressed-644x1024.png\">\n<p>Robert E. Howard wrote two full stories about Dark Agnes de la Fere, &ldquo;Sword Woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blades for France&rdquo;, and left a third, &ldquo;Mistress of Death&rdquo; as incomplete drafts. The tales are set in 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century France, told by Agnes in first person, and they describe fictional but plausible events and intrigues of the period, borrowing real historical figures as necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Dark Agnes stories are surprisingly modern in outlook, with an unflinching look at women&rsquo;s expected roles and lives. Agnes is magnificently defiant about the whole thing, and proceeds to carve an entirely different reality for herself than the one the men around her inhabit. The writing is as good as any of Howard&rsquo;s other work, but the Pulps were a broadly misogynistic market, and the stories weren&rsquo;t published until 1975.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Readers should be aware that &ldquo;Mistress of Death&rdquo; was eventually completed in the &rsquo;70s by Gerald W. Page, who neutered Agnes into a far more typical female character of the time. She has to be rescued from death by her valiant manly companion repeatedly, and at the end of the story, the fellow even reassures her that there&rsquo;s no shame in acting as a woman! Although Howard&rsquo;s original fragments of &ldquo;Mistress of Death&rdquo; have very occasionally been published &ndash; most accessibly in Del Rey&rsquo;s 2011 compilation&nbsp;<em>Sword Woman and Other Historical Adventures</em>&nbsp;&ndash; the great majority of versions out there are the Page adaptation, which is best avoided.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sword Woman&rdquo; opens on Agnes&rsquo;s father describing her as the &ldquo;red-haired spawn of the devil&rdquo;, which is about as polite towards her as he ever gets on page. She&rsquo;s in the forest, wearily gathering a back-straining heap of firewood, but it&rsquo;s the day he has chosen for her wedding &ndash; a fact that she&rsquo;s blanked out of her mind. He&rsquo;s furious at having to come to get her, and gloats that his new son-in-law, Francois, will tame her with violence. She in turn is disgusted by her would-be husband, and utterly enraged at the notion of being tamed. When she tells her father she refuses to marry him, he beats her into unconsciousness &ndash; far from the first time this has occurred.</p>\n<p>She comes round in their hut, dressed in her wedding clothes, too concussed and despairing to rip the hateful finery off. There are sounds of celebration outside, and her sister comes in, ostensibly to rouse her. Ysabel is just a few years older than Agnes, but she is gnarled and bent, her face lined with pain and exhaustion. She laments her brokenness, and although she tells her younger sister that this is the one day in her life when she is allowed to be joyful, that is not her real message. She swiftly takes a darker turn:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&ldquo;Life is a hard thing for a woman. Your tall supple body will grow bent like mine, and broken with childbearing; your hands will become twisted &mdash; and your mind will grow strange and grey &mdash; with the toil and the weariness &mdash; and the everlasting face of a man you hate &hellip; look at me. Would you become as I?&rdquo;</p>\n<cite>&ldquo;SWORD WOMAN&rdquo;, ROBERT E. HOWARD</cite></blockquote>\n<p>She gives Agnes a dagger, and tells her to take the only way out &ndash; suicide. It&rsquo;s the first time Agnes has ever held a weapon, but the blade feels oddly familiar, and rather than kill herself, she hides it in her dress. The celebrants spill into the hut and forcibly drag her outside to greet her new husband. The sight of the loathsome fellow quells her struggles, and she&rsquo;s pushed in front of him to be claimed and taken. In an instant, she pulls out the dagger, stabs Francois through the heart, and runs off. She escapes into the forest despite her father&rsquo;s attempt to shoot her, and the villagers are too scared of the deep woods to pursue her far.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next morning, Agnes wakes up on the forest floor, and the memory of the previous evening fills her with a wild delight, so that she wants to dance and sing. Instead, she cleans Francois&rsquo;s blood off the dagger, and continues on her way. She finds a thin road through the forest, and has not been following it long when she hears an approaching horse. Her instincts warn her to hide, but then she realises that she&rsquo;s not even a little scared. Instead she plants herself in the middle of the road defiantly, dagger in hand.</p>\n<p>The horseman is expensively dressed but down at heel, and in his astonishment accuses her of being a forest-sprite or dawn goddess. He is startled into honestly introducing himself as one Etienne Villiers, formerly of Aquitaine, and after a little conversation, he offers to take her south to Chartres so she can find tavern work. Agnes points out her father will be pursuing her, so Villiers disguises her as a boy, mugging a lad he saw a few minutes earlier for his clothes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They make their way through the forest, and around midday they come to a tavern, the Knaves&rsquo; Fingers. It&rsquo;s an unpleasant place, with an unpleasant host and a guest whom Villiers appears to recognise, but he decides they&rsquo;ll rest there, and takes a room so Agnes can get some sleep. He explains quietly that he doesn&rsquo;t trust the innkeeper, and that they&rsquo;ll move on after sunset.</p>\n<p>She wakes up to find it dark outside, and someone fumbling around the room. When she calls out after Villiers, the intruder exits. Agnes follows, and sees the innkeeper running for the stables and dashing off on horseback. There&rsquo;s no one awake in the tap-room, but in a small room to one side she hears Etienne negotiating her sale with the other guest, Thibault. She bursts in and slaughters Thibault before either man can react. Villiers mounts a desperate defence, and his armour prevents a killing blow, but she clubs him down with a broken table leg, beating him so badly that he can&rsquo;t get up.</p>\n<p>She&rsquo;s going to leave him there to die until she realises that by calling his name earlier, she betrayed his real identity to the innkeeper, and that there is a huge bounty that has been placed on his head by the local Duke. Her hatred for the nobility outweighs her resentment at his betrayal, and she forces him onto his horse and they ride westward for a tavern that he tells her is run by a friend.</p>\n<p>The innkeeper friend, Perducas, is bewildered and intimidated by Agnes and her frank statement that she&rsquo;s the one who has brought Villiers to the edge of death. But he takes the man up to a good room, and the pair of them bind his wounds and set his broken bones. Etienne asks Agnes to stay while he heals, and she consents. Over the following week, she learns that he is being hunted because he used to work for the Duke, and knows details of certain treasons.</p>\n<p>When a famous mercenary captain, Guiscard de Clisson, arrives at the inn, she asks for a place in his company. He tells her she&rsquo;s being silly, and suggests she&rsquo;d do better as his lover, provoking Agnes&rsquo;s best-known enraged outburst:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&ldquo;Ever the man in men!&rdquo; I said between my teeth. &ldquo;Let a woman know her proper place: let her milk and spin and sew and bake and bear children, not look beyond her threshold or the command of her lord and master! Bah! I spit on you all! There is no man alive who can face me with weapons and live, and before I die, I&rsquo;ll prove it to the world. Women! Cows! Slaves! Whimpering, cringing serfs, crouching to blows, revenging themselves by &mdash; taking their own lives, as my sister urged me to do. Ha! You deny me a place among men? By God, I&rsquo;ll live as I please and die as God wills, but if I&rsquo;m not fit to be a man&rsquo;s comrade, at least I&rsquo;ll be no man&rsquo;s mistress. So go ye to hell, Guiscard de Clisson, and may the devil tear your heart!&rdquo;</p>\n<cite>&ldquo;SWORD WOMAN&rdquo;, ROBERT E. HOWARD</cite></blockquote>\n<p>She storms off, leaving Guiscard in absolute astonishment. Villiers is still recovering, and she gets him talking about why he&rsquo;s such a wretch. During that conversation, five of Thibault&rsquo;s comrades find him, determined to kill him because they believe he was the one who murdered their friend. Agnes tells them that she killed the man, but they dismiss her outright. They&rsquo;re about to start torturing Etienne when she hacks the head off one of them, and uses a stolen pistol to execute another. The remaining trio attack her, and although she knows little of formal swordplay, she is ferociously aggressive and lightning-quick, and kills all three.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By the time Perducas the innkeeper arrives, with de Clisson hot on his heels, Agnes is standing by the window, sword in hand. She tells Villiers that her accidental betrayal is repaid, and as she&rsquo;s about to leave, de Clisson offers her the position she asked for earlier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They spend a further week at the tavern, while he outfits her as he deems appropriate for one of his band &ndash; clothing similar to that worn by Red Sonya of Rogatino, along with a good sword, two pistols, and a fine warhorse. Most of that time is spent training her with the weapons. Guiscard is the finest swordsman in France, and Agnes is a natural in the art, learning all manner of techniques and nasty tricks from him.</p>\n<p>As they&rsquo;re leaving, Etienne calls out from his bedroom window that she hasn&rsquo;t even said goodbye. She responds that there is neither debt not friendship between them, and leaves. She and de Clisson have only gone a few miles before they spot a ruffian who slips into the woods at the sight of them. Agnes is certain an ambush is coming, but Guiscard discounts it. Hidden attackers fire on them, killing him and startling her horse into bolting. She is knocked out of her saddle, into bushes, her leg wounded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ambushers fetch their master, a captain named d&rsquo;Valence, who is horrified that the dead man is de Clisson rather than Villiers. He declares that the duke will hang him if he learns of the error, for de Clisson was well-loved, and sends his ruffians out to find Agnes and make sure that she is indeed dead. They give chase, and she is brought to bay against a cliff, sheltering in a narrow cleft. She&rsquo;s able to hold them off with her pistols, so they decide to wait for nightfall to rush her position. There&rsquo;s no way out, but even with death assured, Agnes has no regret for her own end, only for that of Guiscard de Clisson.</p>\n<p>As dusk falls, Etienne arrives at the top of the cliff with a knotted rope for her to climb. He explains that he heard the shooting, found de Clisson&rsquo;s body, and knowing the area, searched along the cliff top until he found her. They are now both being hunted desperately, he by the Duke, and she by his captain, and as far as he&rsquo;s concerned, she is wrong about the absence of debt &ndash; she saved his life. He offers her his comradeship, and they set off, one step ahead of d&rsquo;Valence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the second, shorter story, &ldquo;Blades for France&rdquo;, Agnes and Etienne Villiers are attempting to negotiate an escape from France on the ship of an English pirate, Roger Hawksly. She&rsquo;s heading to a rendezvous with Etienne when she&rsquo;s accosted by &ndash; and slays &ndash; a thug in the forest. She takes his cloak and horse, along with the small amount of money he has, and a black silk mask she finds on him. It&rsquo;s been a while since her last meal, so she stops at a tavern as evening is approaching. While she&rsquo;s eating, a bravo sees her cloak and mistakes her for the man she&rsquo;s just slain. He bids her mask up and follow him to their briefing.</p>\n<p>There are ten of them in the secret meeting, all cloaked and black-masked, and the man who arrives to explain their mission is none other than Captain d&rsquo;Valence. He fails to see through her disguise, and she rides off with the pack into the night. As Agnes gets her horse close, she overhears d&rsquo;Valence talking to one of the men about Hawksly, but she doesn&rsquo;t hesitate in driving her sword between his shoulder-blades. Then she turns to flee, even though she knows that his armour stopped her assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>D&rsquo;Valence does not pursue, and she makes it safely to her rendezvous with Etienne. He tells her that Hawksly&rsquo;s ship has been secretly taken by English enemies, ones led by noblemen. He has no idea why any noble would attack a pirate secretly, but their escape from France is foiled. Then a rider approaches stealthily. Thinking it to be d&rsquo;Valence, Agnes fires, and the horse is killed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rider, however, is a noblewoman, Francoise de Foix, the King&rsquo;s chief mistress. She has been forced to betray an ally &ndash; Charles, Duc de Bourbon &ndash; to his enemies. Charles thinks he is meeting Francoise in a nearby inn, but instead d&rsquo;Valence&rsquo;s men will intercept him. She begs for Etienne and Agnes to help save him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the trio get to the Inn, they discover they are too late. A serving girl who hid during the attack says that d&rsquo;Valence mentioned taking Charles to a ship. Etienne knows a short-cut to the only cove nearby, and they hurry there to find Hawksly&rsquo;s ship in the bay, and d&rsquo;Valence and his men on the beach, talking to some sailors from the ship who&rsquo;ve used a smaller boat to come ashore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>D&rsquo;Valence wants to see Hawksly in person, but the sailors refuse, and begin pulling Charles towards the boat. Realising that the sailor is an English lord, not a pirate, d&rsquo;Valence attempts to kill Charles, to stop the English using him as a pawn against the King. A wild melee immediately ensues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Agnes and Etienne charge in, and attempt to recover the prisoner. While d&rsquo;Valence is desperately trying to kill Charles, he opens himself to Agnes&rsquo;s attack. Once again his armour saves him. They duel for a time, but rather than fall to her blade, he flees the scene. Agnes manages to get to Charles before the English can take him, wounding their leader, Cardinal Wolsey, in the process.</p>\n<p>While the English are distracted by Wolsey&rsquo;s injury, Agnes and Etienne spirit Charles away to where Francoise is waiting. They give their horses to the nobles and send them fleeing off, leaving themselves in a slightly worse position than when they started the story.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">B&Ecirc;LIT</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The most notable of Howard&rsquo;s pirate queen characters, B&ecirc;lit is &ldquo;the wildest she-devil unhanged&rdquo;, the self-titled (and eponymous) Queen of the Black Coast in the 1934 Conan story of the same name. Although she wears only sandals, a red silk girdle, and some jewellery, her skin is as white as ivory. She is a beautiful Shemite woman of old royal stock, slim and lithe yet voluptuous, with dark, flashing eyes, red lips, and long black hair that cascades down her back.&nbsp;</p>\n<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/764966._SX1280_QL80_TTD_-666x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"666\" height=\"1024\">\n<p>During Conan&rsquo;s first sea voyage, she attacks the ship he&rsquo;s on, her pirates quickly overwhelming the crew. He jumps across to her ship, the&nbsp;<em>Tigress</em>, and starts demolishing opponents left and right. They pull back to riddle him with spears, but B&ecirc;lit intervenes. Instead, she offers him the opportunity to become her lover and partner. Conan is as enchanted with her looks and fierceness as she is with his, and the couple become a force of terror feared up and down the coast. She becomes his first and greatest love, an adoration that she matches. During their time together, Conan becomes an expert pirate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eventually, she gets wind of a fabled city up a supposedly cursed river, and they go to try to find and raid it. Instead, they find an ancient temple with a rich treasure of jewels, and a winged ape-monster. Conan encourages her to leave, but despite her love for him, her greed overpowers her. She raids the temple, grabbing a fortune in gems, and in particular a magnificent jewelled necklace. But the necklace is cursed, and she becomes erratic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the same time as they&rsquo;re stealing the treasure, the ape-monster smashes the Tigress&rsquo;s water casks, and it bedevils them over the days that follow. As the crew dwindles, the ape-monster toys with the ship, eventually hanging B&ecirc;lit by her necklace once it has killed all her crew.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conan finally revenges himself on the monster, but only with the help of her soul, which returns from the grave in his instant of direst need. With the beast vanquished, Conan places B&ecirc;lit on a bier on the deck of the&nbsp;<em>Tigress</em>, surrounded by her treasures, and fires the ship, sending it off to a burning burial at sea.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">VALERIA OF THE RED BROTHERHOOD</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">&ldquo;Red Nails&rdquo; was the last Conan story that Howard wrote. Weird Tales was being very slow in paying him at that point, and much as he hated having to think it, he was seriously considering the possibility that it might be his last ever work of fantasy. Determined to say what he meant, he turned the story into a requiem for the idea of civilisation, a final statement about the inevitable corruption that always came. It&rsquo;s amongst the very best of the Conan stories, and remains deeply resonant today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Valeria is an Aquilonian, lithe, supple, strong-limbed, and buxom, with long, golden hair tied back with red satin. She wears a shirt, silk sash, breeches, and flaring boots of soft leather. More importantly, she&rsquo;s a seasoned adventurer and an expert fighter, someone even Conan views with wary respect.</p>\n<p>Much of the story is told from Valeria&rsquo;s viewpoint. She&rsquo;s a respected pirate and an ongoing acquaintance of Conan&rsquo;s. The pair have recently fled from the army that they&rsquo;d been working for, Valeria because she killed an officer who was attempting to rape her, with Conan following, because he admired both her beauty and her spirit. Along the way, they find a long-lost city on a monster-filled plain. The current inhabitants are not numerous, and they welcome Conan and Valeria in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After some discussion, the residents offer the newcomers heaps of treasure to help them defeat the monsters on the plains. The creatures &ndash; plainly dinosaurs, not that any of the characters know the term &ndash; have kept the folk penned in the city for more than fifty years, and they are desperate to be rid of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-518 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroines 4\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/valeria-689x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroines\" width=\"239\" height=\"354\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/valeria-689x1024.jpg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\">\n<p>But there is, inevitably, treachery afoot. One of the city&rsquo;s rulers is an ageless sorceress, and she seeks to consume Valeria&rsquo;s soul in order to feed her own youthfulness. Her husband, unheeding of her plans, tries to rape Valeria, but is stopped and imprisoned by his wife for his pains. Conan frees him, and is then forced to kill him in self-defence. By the time it is all over, Valeria and Conan are the only living people in the whole city. They set off together for the coast, to find a ship and resume their piratical endeavours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Valeria&rsquo;s name was borrowed for a character in the 1982 John Milius film&nbsp;<em>Conan the Barbarian</em>. There was more of B&ecirc;lit in the movie character than of Valeria though, and her outfits tended towards the glittering and skimpy.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HONOURABLE MENTIONS</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The line between Howard&rsquo;s women heroes and his incidental female characters is not hard and fast. Plenty of them were skilled, brave, and independent. Both the Caribbean pirate Helen Tavrel (&ldquo;The Isle of Pirates&rsquo; Doom&rdquo;) and the Celtic princess Helen of Briton (&ldquo;Tigers of the Sea&rdquo;) are well worth consideration. Zenobia, Conan&rsquo;s queen during his rule of Aquilonia, is definitely of interest, as are Yasmina, the Devi of Vendhya, in &ldquo;The People of the Black Circle&rdquo;, and Glory McGraw (<em>A Gent from Bear Creek</em>). Time and space are limited, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to look at the Pulps in general, the Conan stories &ndash; and their illustrations &ndash; in particular, and at what the &rsquo;70s did to Howard&rsquo;s work, and to decide that the man was a towering misogynist. It&rsquo;s an entirely reasonable conclusion. It&rsquo;s also utterly wrong. He loathed the restrictions that civilisation placed on women as much as the fetters he felt himself bound by. Indeed, his continued existence in a world he despised was nothing less than an act of devotion to his mother. If his work sometimes suggested otherwise, that is the reflection of the commercial environment he was in rather than of any convictions on his part. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Robert E. Howard undoubtedly had many flaws, but sexism was not one of them.</p>\n</div>', '2023-10-24T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/robert-e-howard-article-4-compressed-2048x1280.jpg');

Howard wrote many hundreds of stories over the course of his life, and hundreds of poems as well. It&rsquo;s an amazing amount of work, given how young he died. It&rsquo;s not possible here to examine an exhaustive list of his heroes and protagonists. Others far better qualified than this writer have done so in the past. What this article attempts to do is to look at some of the most developed and interesting of his literary creations. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">KULL OF ATLANTIS</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The most chronologically distant of Howard&rsquo;s major characters, Kull appears at first glance as just a clumsy initial version of Conan. He is, after all, a mighty barbarian wanderer who takes control of a civilized kingdom and bends it to his will. But unless you look past that gloss, you&rsquo;ll completely miss the point of not only Kull, but of Conan as well.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-384 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 1\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"211\" height=\"354\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\"></p>\n<p>A hundred thousand years ago, Atlantis still stood above the waves, but most of humanity lived on the continent of Thuria, roughly equivalent to modern Eurasia. Little else of the world was above the waves. Kull was born in Atlantis&rsquo;s Tiger Valley, but the land flooded while he was still young. Only some former mountains survived, as islands, and after a feral time, Kull was adopted into one of these sea-mountain tribes. After being banished, he spent an unsuccessful time as a pirate and then bandit, before being captured by the kingdom of Valusia and made to fight as a gladiator. He became famous and popular, eventually winning freedom as a soldier. He rose swiftly in the army, and the loyalty he gained there permitted him to overthrow the cruel, hated king and replace him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The earliest story in Kull&rsquo;s own timeline is &ldquo;Exile of Atlantis.&rdquo; A tribeswoman who had fled to marry into enemy tribe is shipwrecked in her home territory. The tribe decide to burn her at the stake. Kull is perplexed, and tries to help her, but the best he can do is grant her a swift death. Because of this, he has to flee for his life. By the time of the next story, he is established in Valusia. He considers the ancient kingdom decadent and hidebound, their laws petty and cruel. By the time of &ldquo;The Shadow Kingdom,&rdquo; he has replaced the previous king, and is forced to contend with constant conspiracy, backbiting, and the treat of assassination.</p>\n<p>In the stories that follow, he devotes much of his time to defending life, throne, and kingdom from threats, often sorcerous. He has firm allies &ndash; the Pictish warrior Brule the Spear-slayer, and a cynical first councillor named Tu &ndash; and a dire enemy, the undead sorcerer Thusla Doom of movie fame. But alongside his adventures, he is also deeply concerned with matters of decency and fairness, particularly as they oppose the laws of civilisation. He forgives insults and treacheries, permits open rivals to live, reshapes laws to allow lovers to marry, and considers poets more worthy than kings. Life is a momentary dream, and kingdoms something to be tolerated, even his own. When a friend turns traitor, Kull&rsquo;s regret is that the young man felt driven to such extremes. Despite his decency towards women, he has no interest in romance with either gender.</p>\n<p>In Kull, Howard created the ideal expression of his values. Kull is a physical exemplar, strong and fast and with incredible resilience. He is free of the corrupting cruelty of civilization, having grown alongside animals in the wild. Although he places huge stock on his freedom, and is quick to slay those who raise arms against him, he is just and generous, and does not take his own power to heart. On the contrary, he deliberately weakens his apparent position time and again to do what is fair. He respects women, but does not inflict himself on them, even if they would be enthusiastic. He admires poets and scenes of beauty, sees life as a whimsy, and constantly wonders about its, and his, reality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kull is the man that Howard thought all men should be, the man he longed to be himself. However, to his regret, Kull just wasn&rsquo;t a successful character. Howard wrote twelve stories and one poem about him, and was able to sell only three, all to Weird Tales. Conan exists precisely because of Kull&rsquo;s failure, a direct reaction to the commercial rejection of his own personal creed.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CONAN THE BARBARIAN</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&ldquo;Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world &hellip; Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.&rdquo;</p>\n<cite><em>THE PHOENIX ON THE SWORD</em>, R. E. HOWARD.</cite></blockquote>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is somewhat ironic that for many people, Conan is synonymous with Robert E. Howard. The towering barbarian lived during the Hyborian Age, a period of romantic history which came between the destruction of Atlantis and the first traces of real historic civilisation. Although Howard never specified a clear date, signs in his work suggest this was meant to be shortly after the end of the last ice age, around 14,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conan was a Cimmerian, a member of an early Celtic tribe who roamed the region north of the Black Sea. He was the son of a blacksmith, born on a battlefield, strong as a titan and already a savage warrior by the age of a fifteen. Wanderlust took him, and he began stalking the nations of the Hyborian Age, plundering and murdering his way as a thief, a bandit, an outlaw, a pirate, or a mercenary depending on the fortunes of the day. On the occasions when he agreed to serve under another man, he invariably proved himself a traitor, overthrowing the fellow to seize power. As his reputation grew, so did the number of men under his command, so his ambitions grew with them. Several times, his entire force was wiped out in some failed scheme, yet this did little to stop his rise. Eventually, in his forties, he overthrew the king of Aquilonia, the Hyborian Age&rsquo;s most powerful nation, and seized the country for his own.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-385 entered exited\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 2\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"246\" height=\"361\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-1.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>In modern terms, the Conan who Howard described in his stories is scum, a life-long murderer and criminal motivated almost entirely by selfishness. That&rsquo;s the whole point, in fact. After the failure of Kull, Howard decided that the civilised public were too corrupted to accept a thoughtful, moral hero, and so he set out to deliberately devise a savage who would titillate them. He&rsquo;s a deliberate caricature of the gangsters and roughnecks who swaggered through oil-boom Texas breaking every law, and treating other humans as annoyances to be bullied, shot, or molested depending on circumstance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And yet&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Howard&rsquo;s stories, Conan is usually encountered fresh from some atrocity or other, having just plundered this place or murdered that group. After the story closes, often with the barbarian&rsquo;s latest scheme having failed to yield the vast sums he hoped for, it&rsquo;s frequently assumed that he&rsquo;s setting off for more banditry or piracy. But on the actual page, Conan is surprisingly well-behaved for a savage criminal. He&rsquo;s wildly violent in defence of his life and interests of course, a monstrously dangerous warrior of incredible might and speed, but we rarely actually see him act with cruelty or wanton greed. Rather than the bare-chested monosyllabic barbarian of the comics and movies, he&rsquo;s a highly educated man, erudite and well-spoken, habitually dressed in good-quality clothing of whichever nation he happens to be in at the time.</p>\n<p>Despite his never-ending lust, he&rsquo;s also surprisingly chivalrous. He is deeply reluctant to fight a woman, even one trying to kill him. In fact, he goes well out of his way to save women time and again, even if doing so means throwing away months of hard work and a vast payout. He even hands over his own hard-won fortune to a hard-up woman at least once, for no reward other than satisfaction. Over the course of his written adventures, we usually see Conan doing undisputed good, slaying horrible monsters, evil wizards, and cruel tyrants. Even when he&rsquo;s killing other mortal men, they&rsquo;re usually either criminals and murderers themselves, or enemy armies, or fellow savages, sworn to the same code of freedom over all.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-393 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 3\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-7-1024x760.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"760\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-7-1024x760.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\">\n<figcaption>Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>If you imagine Conan&rsquo;s claims about his own deeds as nothing but wild bragging, and measure him only by the events Howard actually depicted, he&rsquo;s a totally different character. He becomes a plaything of the gods, a hero who helps the world despite himself, led by the nose from adventure to adventure by the false promise of gold, jewels, or supple flesh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Howard&rsquo;s intrinsic decency shines through Conan&rsquo;s supposed amoral selfishness, and it&rsquo;s this contradiction that gives the character the power and enduring popularity that he still has today. Conan is the perfect bad-boy, all sullen, smouldering blue eyes and pantherish muscle, boasting endlessly about all the people he&rsquo;s beaten up and the crimes he&rsquo;s committed, but who still takes pains to help his elderly neighbour with her shopping when he thinks no one is looking. And we still love him for it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BRAN MAK MORN</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The last king of Howard&rsquo;s Picts was something of a racial throwback. In real history, the name was used by the Romans to refer to a tribe of late Iron Age people who lived in northern and eastern Scotland. It&rsquo;s usually assumed that they were descended from the&nbsp;<em>Caledonii</em>, Britons from the Celtic diaspora across Europe who&rsquo;d been forced North by the Roman invasion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-386 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 4\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"234\" height=\"388\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-2.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\"></p>\n<p>In Howard&rsquo;s vision, the Picts were contemporaries of Kull, island folk from the Western Ocean. They survived the final sinking of Atlantis and Valusia, but suffered significant cultural decline down through the following centuries, appearing occasionally in Conan stories as half-wild foes. By the time of Bran, somewhere around the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;century AD, they had been pushed into the wilds of northern Scotland, where they became ignorant, and interbred with the locals. Bran himself is said to be a descendant of Brule the Spear-Slayer, who was King Kull&rsquo;s greatest friend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike his people, Bran was a return to the Pictish elder stock, taller, brighter, a better warrior. By comparison, those around him were short and twisted, ferociously strong but almost caveman-like, with gnarled limbs and small black eyes. He was a one-off, the high-point of his people, and although he tried to build them up and help them regain their lost glory, he knew that their time was done. He recognised the futility of his calling, that his people were doomed and his reality was a small bubble in the mad chaos of life, and yet he fought for their future because it was his job. His life was one of service to his people, to try to prepare them for what was to come. Whether or not this was possible was of absolutely no relevance.</p>\n<p>After Bran&rsquo;s death, his debased people made him into a god. Part of his consciousness was preserved in a statue, and he was worshipped as the Dark Man. A cult to him even survived down through the centuries, with his idol and its cultists surfacing again in &ldquo;Children of the Night,&rdquo; a Lovecraftian horror story set in the 1930s.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SOLOMON KANE</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The closest of Howard&rsquo;s pure fantasy characters to contemporary times, Solomon Kane was born in south-west England some time during the 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. A devout puritan, he entered the merchant navy to flee religious persecution and rose to the rank of captain, eventually even spending some time as a buccaneer against the Spanish. The skills he acquired during this period became the foundation for his lifelong crusade against evil in all its forms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An utterly serious individual, relentless and driven, Kane embodied puritan wrath. His physical presence reflected this &ndash; tall, graceful, wolfishly lean, with long limbs and iron muscles under his plain black clothing, and a long, melancholy face. He possessed the astonishing vitality and strength common to most of Howard&rsquo;s characters of course, and was both a dead-shot and one of Europe&rsquo;s greatest swordsmen. The pulps demanded no less than physical exceptionalism. Unlike some of the other characters however, his primary drive was to simply seek out evil, supernatural or otherwise, and end it.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-387 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 5\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-3-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-3-1024x576.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\">\n<figcaption>Promo from the&nbsp;<em>Solomon Kane</em>&nbsp;movie</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Looking at the stories, it&rsquo;s no stretch to describe Kane as demented. He&rsquo;s not just a fanatic, he actually believes himself to be the instrument of God&rsquo;s vengeance. Despite his piety, he carries a magical staff out of antiquity, a gift from his witch-doctor friend that later proves to be the Staff of Solomon. He justifies his wanderlust and his deep need for the thrill of adventure as a continual hunt for righteous causes as guided by God himself. There is nothing else of importance to him, and sometimes this allows his urge to deliver justice to drive him into near-suicidal foolishness. Fortunately, his burning hatred of evil and the iron rage it kindles always permit him to win through.</p>\n<p>But is it actually madness if he&rsquo;s right? The stories never answer the question either way, but in his last appearance, a poem, he is old, returning home to contemplate a retirement. He does not get there. Instead, he turns around and heads away again, giving even his old age to his endless crusade. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JOHN KIROWAN</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The primary character for many of Howard&rsquo;s contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos was Professor John Kirowan, whose adventures were set in the modern day &ndash; that is, around the time of publication in the 1930s. Kirowan was a tall and slender Irishman from Galway, the son of local gentry. Always attracted to dark secrets, he was alienated from his parents, and his main anchor to the everyday world was his twin sister Moira, a laughing, joyful girl.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his youth, he found his way to Hungary in pursuit of deep occult secrets. There, he met a man named Vrolok, and the two studied together for a time. As Vrolok sank deeper into dark magic, Kirowan abandoned him. In revenge, Vrolok corrupted Moira, who had come to Hungary, and set her against her brother. Kirowan and Vrolok fought inconclusively, and after Kirowan fled, the Hungarian abandoned Moira, who killed herself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deeply scarred, perpetually sorrowing, Kirowan swore vengeance on Vrolok and travelled the world in search of sufficient occult power to defeat the man. Eventually, sickened by the debauchery of the occult, he swore off and moved to America. Here he joined an eccentric organisation called The Wanderer&rsquo;s Club. In the company of his close friend and fellow Wanderer&rsquo;s Club member John Conrad, Kirowan turned his learning against sources of cult and occult menace. Eventually, he even managed to get his revenge on his enemy.</p>\n<p>While he is still unusually strong and resilient, Kirowan is interesting as a more intellectual hero than many of Howard&rsquo;s other creations. He is haunted by his past and his guilt about it, but not to a crippling degree. He engages with the world to an extent, even as he remains prepared to turn the knowledge he has gained to good ends. Of course, part of the nature of the mythos is that brawn is rarely enough, but even so, it is easy to find hints of Howard himself in the tall, saddened professor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">EL BORAK</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Howard created the character of Frank Gordon when he was just ten, but the Francis Xavier Gordon who finally saw print was a considerably more sophisticated beast inspired by Lawrence of Arabia, Sir Richard Burton, and Gordon of Khartoum. The El Borak stories are pure adventure, free of romantic history and with (almost) no hint of fantasy.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-388 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 6\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"214\" height=\"335\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-4.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\"></p>\n<p>A gunslinger of Scottish and Irish ancestry from El Paso, Gordon traveled the world in his youth, eventually settling in Afghanistan. A short, slender man, his greatest asset was his speed &ndash; he was a lightning-fast gunman and knife fighter, but also a very quick thinker. It was this characteristic that earned him his nickname from the locals, for El Borak translates to the Swift. He devoted much of his time to keeping the peace in the country, trying to avert wars and catastrophes, and to right injustices.</p>\n<p>Whilst Gordon&rsquo;s adventures in the Middle East are purely adventure stories, the pulp adventure genre rewarded writers for taking significant liberties with what was actually plausible. So in one tale, he stumbles across a lost civilisation peopled by the remnants of the army of Alexander the Great while trying to prevent a war with India. In another, he&rsquo;s attempting to save the life of a woman who has presented herself as a goddess to the people of a forbidden city &ndash; not from her worshippers, but from her abandoned husband. Even in his more realistic fictions, Howard was a devout lover of the fantastical.</p>\n<p>Kirby O&rsquo;Donnell was a minor second American adventurer in Afghanistan, created in El Borak&rsquo;s mould. The main point of divergence between the two is motivation &ndash; while Gordon is dedicated to regional stability, O&rsquo;Donnell is a treasure-hunter seeking wondrous ancient loot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SAILOR STEVE COSTIGAN</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The hero of a whole host of humorous boxing stories, Steve Costigan was one of Howard&rsquo;s most financially successful characters. The stories were firmly in the tall tales mould, characterised by misdirection, understatement, exaggeration, and unreliability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-389 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 7\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-5.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"196\" height=\"310\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-5.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\"></p>\n<p>The folk art of the tall tale is a subject all of its own, a deeply-embedded part of the Southwestern American psyche, and Howard grew up surrounded by expert yarn-spinners. The great success of his humorous work is a testament to his facility with the art. Costigan was such a popular character that Howard had to eventually rename the character to Dennis Dorgan in a few stories written for rival magazines to his usual venues.</p>\n<p>Steve Costigan was an enthusiastic life-long boxer. Born in Galveston, Texas, he was of Irish descent. He had a younger brother, Mike, who was also a boxer, and even more successful than Steve was. Once he reached fourteen, Steve took to the sea. He signed on to the merchant ship&nbsp;<em>Sea Girl</em>&nbsp;out of San Francisco at seventeen, and quickly attained the rank of able seaman. Despite stints on other vessels, the&nbsp;<em>Sea Girl&nbsp;</em>was always his home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Costigan&rsquo;s most reliable companion was a bulldog, named Mike after his brother, whom he adopted as a stray while in Dublin. Other common characters from the&nbsp;<em>Sea Girl</em>&nbsp;included Bill O&rsquo;Brien, another boxing Irish American and Steve&rsquo;s best friend; Sven Larson, a Swedish sailor who was forever trying to take the title of ship&rsquo;s champion from Costigan, and Mushy Hanson, a Danish boxing sailor who writes poetry and collects cheap novels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The eternal underdog, Costigan lacks the skill, strength and reflexes found in many of Howard&rsquo;s other characters. Like the Iron Men of the boxing world who inspired him, Costigan&rsquo;s sole fighting virtue is sheer stubbornness &ndash; he soaks up punishment like a sponge, and refuses to give up. He&rsquo;s quick-tempered and ignorant but big-hearted, the perpetual dumb sucker who falls victim to every hard luck grift he encounters. Even if he never actually seems to get the girl, he still wins his fights with his relentless spirit. As such, he&rsquo;s the perfect foil for Howard&rsquo;s humour, and if he never gets the prize he&rsquo;s after, he&rsquo;s also very much never the loser.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BRECKENRIDGE ELKINS</h2>\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The land-bound counterpart to Sailor Steve Costigan, Breckenridge Elkins was another humorous character embedded in the tall tale genre. However, while Costigan&rsquo;s stories were boxing tales, the Elkins yarns were Westerns, at least in the broad sense. That brought them closer to the tall tale core, and they were phenomenally popular. Breck was by far Howard&rsquo;s most commercially successful character, and if he is obscure now, it is only because tall tales have fallen out of favor while fantasy has gone from strength to strength. Like Costigan, Elkins was so popular that Howard was eventually asked to re-skin him, and he also appeared under the name of Pike Bearfield.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-390 entered lazyloaded\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8px 16px 8px 16px;\" title=\"Howard\'s Heroes 8\" src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-6.jpeg\" alt=\"Conan Howard\'s Heroes\" width=\"229\" height=\"359\" data-lazy-src=\"https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/public-jpeg-6.jpeg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\"></p>\n<p>Elkins was a hillbilly, an ignorant, sometimes illiterate giant from Bear Creek, a tiny and imaginary place in the Nevada Mountains, and was usually found with his bad-tempered horse, Cap&rsquo;n Kidd. Although he was huge and muscular, he was as dumb as a post, and while he was always trying to be helpful to friends and family, he usually succeeded only in adding to his own problems. With a reputation throughout the southwest of the USA for both his short temper and his fierce fighting skills, he was feared and admired in equal parts.</p>\n<p>The Elkins stories are classic misadventures told unreliably by the man himself. While he&rsquo;s happy to talk up his fights and physical challenges well beyond the bounds of any physical possibility, and there&rsquo;s a great deal of humour in the exaggeration, it is his constant inability to understand the people and situations around him that provide most of the laughs. Inevitably, things get increasingly complicated as he blunders through the story, falling back on his strength and fists to set things straight. As with Sailor Steve Costigan, a common theme of the Elkins stories is his constant failure in romantic affairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss tall tales as an outdated whimsy, but the truth is that for years, they were the shared mythology of the people who transplanted themselves into the American Southwest. In a time before radio, when books were scarce, and life much the same day to day and month to month, tall tales were the heart of the oral tradition, a survival of the same literary strand that gave us Hercules and Achilles. A good &lsquo;Tall Liar&rsquo; was, quite literally, a community treasure.</p>\n<p>Elkins provided Howard with the opportunity to tap directly into that vein of story that had surrounded him for his entire life. It may be that in those yarns, his deepest, most genuine voice was finally able to find expression.</p>', '2023-10-25T12:35:22', 1, 0, 'https://conan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/robert-e-howard-article-2-compressed-2048x1280.jpg');
